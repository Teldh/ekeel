FALSE,NETWORK,OPEN NETWORK,16,strong,6,Another means of classifying networks is based on whether the network's internal operation is based on designs that are in the public domain or on innovations owned and controlled by a particular entity such as an individual or a corporation.,"A network of the former type is called an open network; a network of the latter type is called a closed, or sometimes a proprietary, network.",Open network designs are freely circulated and often grow in popularity to the point that they ultimately prevail over proprietary approaches whose applications are restricted by license fees and contract conditions.,,,,,,,0,0,"NETWORK,OPEN_NETWORK","NETWORK,OPEN NETWORK",
FALSE,ROUTER,GATEWAY,111,strong,6,"Gateways can be found in a variety of forms, and thus the term is used rather loosely.",In many cases a network's gateway is merely the router through which it communicates with the rest of the internet.,In other cases the term gateway may be used to refer to more than just a router.,,,,,,,0,0,"ROUTER,GATEWAY","ROUTER,GATEWAY",

FALSE,ACCESS POINT,HOT SPOT,194,strong,6,The strategy is to connect the access point to an access internet service provider and thus provide internet access through that internet service provider to end systems within the access point's broadcast range.,"The area within the access point or group of access points' range is often called a hot spot, particularly when the network access is publicly available or free.","Hot spots can be found in individual residences, hotel and office buildings, small businesses, parks, and in some cases span entire cities.",,,,,,,0,0,"ACCESS_POINT,HOT_SPOT","ACCESS POINT,HOT SPOT",
