TRUE,SOFTWARE,MALICIOUS SOFTWARE,598,strong,5,There are numerous ways that a computer system and its contents can be attacked via network connections.,Many of these incorporate the use of malicious software (collectively called malware).,"Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.",,,,,,,,0,"SOFTWARE,MALICIOUS_SOFTWARE",0,,,,,

TRUE,SOFTWARE,ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE,674,strong,5,"In effect, auditing software is an administrator's primary tool for identifying problems before they grow out of control.","Another means of defense against invasions via network connections is software called antivirus software, which is used to detect and remove the presence of known viruses and other infections.","Actually, antivirus software represents a broad class of software products, each designed to detect and remove a specific type of infection.",,,,,,,,1,"SOFTWARE,ANTIVIRUS_SOFTWARE",1,,,,,
TRUE,COMPUTER,COMPUTER SYSTEM,1,strong,6,,"The need to share information and resources among different computers has led to linked computer systems, called networks, in which computers are connected so that data can be transferred from machine to machine.","In these networks, computer users can exchange messages and share resources-such as printing capabilities, software packages, and data storage facilities-that are scattered throughout the system.",,,,,,,,0,"COMPUTER,COMPUTER_SYSTEM",0,,,,,

TRUE,NETWORK,OPEN NETWORK,16,strong,6,Another means of classifying networks is based on whether the network's internal operation is based on designs that are in the public domain or on innovations owned and controlled by a particular entity such as an individual or a corporation.,"A network of the former type is called an open network; a network of the latter type is called a closed, or sometimes a proprietary, network.",Open network designs are freely circulated and often grow in popularity to the point that they ultimately prevail over proprietary approaches whose applications are restricted by license fees and contract conditions.,,,,,,,,0,"NETWORK,OPEN_NETWORK",0,,,,,
TRUE,ROUTER,GATEWAY,112,strong,6,In many cases a network's gateway is merely the router through which it communicates with the rest of the internet.,In other cases the term gateway may be used to refer to more than just a router.,"For example, in most residential wifi networks that are connected to the Internet, the term gateway refers collectively to both the network's access point and the router connected to the access point because these two devices are normally packaged in a single unit.",,,,,,,,0,"ROUTER,GATEWAY",0,,,,,
