TRUE,MAIL SERVER,INTERNET MAIL ACCESS PROTOCOL,300,strong,5,There are two popular protocols that may be used for accessing email that has arrived and accumulated at a user's mail server.,"These are POP3 (post office protocol version 3) and internet mail access protocol (IMAP). post office protocol version 3 (pronounced "" pop-THREE "") is the simpler of the two.","Using post office protocol version 3, a user transfers (downloads) messages to his or her local computer where they can be read, stored in various folders, edited, and otherwise manipulated as the user desires.",,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,MAIL SERVER,INTERNET MAIL ACCESS PROTOCOL,303,strong,5,This is done on the user's local machine using the local machine's mass storage.,"internet mail access protocol (pronounced "" EYE-map "") allows a user to store and manipulate messages and related materials on the same machine as the mail server.","In this manner, a user who must access his or her email from different computers can maintain records at the mail server that are then accessible from any remote computer to which the user may have access.",,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,NETWORK,4G,335,strong,5,"The Third Generation ("" 3G "") phone network provided higher data rates, allowing for mobile video calls and other bandwidth-intensive activities.","The 4G network provides even higher data rates and a fully packet-switched internet protocol network, which has allowed smartphones to enjoy the connectivity and flexibility previously available only to broadband-enabled PCs.","The Generations of wireless telephones Mobile phone technology has evolved rapidly since the first simple, handheld electronic units were introduced in the 1980s.",,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,SERVER,CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK,344,strong,5,"In order for this type of streaming to scale to thousands or even millions of simultaneous users, each with his or her own personal stream, replication of the content to many distinct servers is essential.","Large-scale streaming services make use of content delivery networks (CDNs), groups of servers distributed strategically around the Internet that specialize in streaming copies of content to nearby end users in their network "" neighborhood "".","In many cases, content delivery networks machines may reside in an access internet service provider network, allowing customers of that access internet service provider to stream copies of multimedia content at high speed from a nearby server that is much closer in the network than the streaming service's central server machines.",,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,MNEMONIC ADDRESS,UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR,364,strong,5,"Thus to view a webpage, a person first provides his or her browser with the uniform resource locator of the desired document and then instructs the browser to retrieve and display the document.",A typical uniform resource locator is presented in Figure 4.8.,"It consists of four segments: the protocol to use to communicate with the server controlling access to the document, the mnemonic address of the machine containing the server, the directory path needed for the server to find the directory containing the document, and the name of the document itself.",,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,SERVER,SERVER-SIDE ACTIVITY,461,strong,5,"On the basis of this information, the customer would specify the destinations of interest and desired dates of travel (a client-side activity).","This information would then be transferred back to the agent's server where it would be used to construct the appropriate customized webpage (a server-side activity), which would then be sent to the customer's browser.",Another example occurs when using the services of a search engine.,,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,SERVER,SERVER-SIDE ACTIVITY,457,strong,5,These needs would require additional activity by either the browser or the webserver.,Such activities are called client-side activities if they are performed by a client (such as a browser) or server-side activities if they are performed by a server (such as a webserver).,"As an example, suppose a travel agent wanted customers to be able to identify desired destinations and dates of travel, at which time the agent would present the customer with a customized webpage containing only the information pertinent to that customer's needs.",,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,SERVER,APPLICATION LAYER,508,strong,5,We begin our journey with the application layer.,The application layer consists of those software units such as clients and servers that use Internet communication to carry out their tasks.,"Although the names are similar, this layer is not restricted to software in the application classification presented in Section 3.2, but also includes many utility packages.",,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,ROUTER,NETWORK LAYER,523,strong,5,It is the network layer's job to decide in which direction a packet should be sent at each step along the packet's path through the Internet.,"In fact, the combination of the network layer and the link layer below it constitutes the software residing on the Internet routers.",The network layer is in charge of maintaining the router's forwarding table and using that table to determine the direction in which to forward packets.,,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,FORWARDING TABLE,NETWORK LAYER,524,strong,5,"In fact, the combination of the network layer and the link layer below it constitutes the software residing on the Internet routers.",The network layer is in charge of maintaining the router's forwarding table and using that table to determine the direction in which to forward packets.,The link layer at the router is in charge of receiving and transmitting the packets.,,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,INTERNET,TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL/INTERNET PROTOCOL PROTOCOL SUITE,560,strong,5,"It is an often-quoted model because it carries the authority of an international organization, but it has been slow to replace the four-level point of view, mainly because it was established after the four-level hierarchy had already become the de facto standard for the Internet.",The transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite is a collection of protocol standards used by the Internet to implement the four-level communication hierarchy.,"Actually, the transmission control protocol (TCP) and the internet protocol (IP) are the names of only two of the protocols in this vast collection-so the fact that the entire collection is referred to as the transmission control protocol/internet protocol protocol suite is rather misleading.",,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,INTERNET,INTERNET PROTOCOL,580,strong,5,"For example, the efficiency of user datagram protocol makes it the protocol of choice for domain name system lookups and voice over internet protocol.","However, because email is less time sensitive, mail servers use transmission control protocol to transfer email. internet protocol is the Internet's standard for implementing the tasks assigned to the network layer.","We have already observed that this task consists of forwarding, which involves relaying packets through the Internet, and routing, which involves updating the layer's forwarding table to reflect changing conditions.",,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,SOFTWARE,MALICIOUS SOFTWARE,598,strong,5,There are numerous ways that a computer system and its contents can be attacked via network connections.,Many of these incorporate the use of malicious software (collectively called malware).,"Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.",,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,SOFTWARE,VIRUS,606,strong,5,The Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center maintains a website at http://www.cert.org where it posts notices of its activities.,A virus is software that infects a computer by inserting itself into programs that already reside in the machine.,"Then, when the "" host "" program is executed, the virus is also executed.",,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,SOFTWARE,SPYWARE,620,strong,5,"Thus, email attachments from unknown sources should never be opened.","Another form of malicious software is spyware (sometimes called sniffing software), which is software that collects information about activities at the computer on which it resides and reports that information back to the instigator of the attack.","Some companies use spyware as a means of building customer profiles, and in this context, it has questionable ethical merit.",,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,SOFTWARE,ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE,674,strong,5,"In effect, auditing software is an administrator's primary tool for identifying problems before they grow out of control.","Another means of defense against invasions via network connections is software called antivirus software, which is used to detect and remove the presence of known viruses and other infections.","Actually, antivirus software represents a broad class of software products, each designed to detect and remove a specific type of infection.",,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,COMPUTER,COMPUTER SYSTEM,1,strong,6,,"The need to share information and resources among different computers has led to linked computer systems, called networks, in which computers are connected so that data can be transferred from machine to machine.","In these networks, computer users can exchange messages and share resources-such as printing capabilities, software packages, and data storage facilities-that are scattered throughout the system.",,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,SOFTWARE,NETWORK SOFTWARE,3,strong,6,"In these networks, computer users can exchange messages and share resources-such as printing capabilities, software packages, and data storage facilities-that are scattered throughout the system.",The underlying software required to support such applications has grown from simple utility packages into an expanding system of network software that provides a sophisticated network-wide infrastructure.,"In a sense, network software is evolving into a network-wide operating system.",,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,NETWORK,OPEN NETWORK,16,strong,6,Another means of classifying networks is based on whether the network's internal operation is based on designs that are in the public domain or on innovations owned and controlled by a particular entity such as an individual or a corporation.,"A network of the former type is called an open network; a network of the latter type is called a closed, or sometimes a proprietary, network.",Open network designs are freely circulated and often grow in popularity to the point that they ultimately prevail over proprietary approaches whose applications are restricted by license fees and contract conditions.,,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,ROUTER,GATEWAY,111,strong,6,"Gateways can be found in a variety of forms, and thus the term is used rather loosely.",In many cases a network's gateway is merely the router through which it communicates with the rest of the internet.,In other cases the term gateway may be used to refer to more than just a router.,,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,INTERNET,INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER,172,strong,6,"As we have already mentioned, the Internet is a collection of connected networks.","In general, these networks are constructed and maintained by organizations called internet service providers (ISPs).",It is also customary to use the term internet service provider in reference to the networks themselves.,,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,ACCESS POINT,HOT SPOT,194,strong,6,The strategy is to connect the access point to an access internet service provider and thus provide internet access through that internet service provider to end systems within the access point's broadcast range.,"The area within the access point or group of access points' range is often called a hot spot, particularly when the network access is publicly available or free.","Hot spots can be found in individual residences, hotel and office buildings, small businesses, parks, and in some cases span entire cities.",,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,ACCESS POINT,HOT SPOT,205,strong,6,These technologies may be used to provide direct connection to an end system or to a customer's router to which multiple end systems are connected.,This latter tactic is popular for individual residences where a local hot spot is created by a router / access point connected to an access internet service provider by means of existing cable or telephone lines.,"Telephone, cable television, and satellite wide area networks of the twentieth century were designed to carry analog communications, such as the human voice or pre-digital television signals.",,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,SERVER,NAME SERVER,245,strong,6,"Thus, if a human wants to send a message to a distant machine and identifies the destination by means of a mnemonic address, the software being used must be able to convert that address into an internet protocol address before transmitting the message.","This conversion is performed with the aid of numerous servers, called name servers, that are essentially directories that provide address translation services to clients.","Collectively, these name servers are used as an Internet-wide directory system known as the domain name system (DNS).",,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,SOFTWARE,BROWSER,355,strong,6,Web Implementation,Software packages that allow users to access hypertext on the Internet fall into one of two categories: browsers and webservers.,A browser resides on the user's computer and is charged with the tasks of obtaining materials requested by the user and presenting these materials to the user in an organized manner.,,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,MALICIOUS SOFTWARE,SPYWARE,600,strong,6,"Such software might be transferred to, and executed on, the computer itself, or it might attack the computer from a distance.","Examples of software that is transferred to, and executed on, the computer under attack include viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware, whose names reflect the primary characteristic of the software.",The Computer Emergency Response Team In November 1988 a worm released into the Internet caused significant disruption of service.,,,,,,,,,,
TRUE,SERVER,PROXY SERVER,659,strong,6,"These filters are examples of how a variety of subject areas (probability theory, artificial intelligence, etc.) can jointly contribute to developments in other fields.",Another preventative tool that has filtering connotations is the proxy server.,A proxy server is a software unit that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server with the goal of shielding the client from adverse actions of the server.,,,,,,,,,,
