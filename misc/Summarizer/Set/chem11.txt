We'll cut right to the chase.
And that's bread.
It's really the best bread in town.
There's Frank.
He founded Bricco.
It's in the South end.
It's amazing.
Oil and passione.
Passione.
Passion.
That's not the time to do it.
All sorts of stuff.
You can't-we're going beyond 2D.
We're coming out of the board.
We're going 3D.
You got to hold it in your hand.
It's actually going to have different properties.
And I'm certain at some point we're going to hear loud clinking sounds of these balls falling apart.
They're not held together too well.
The number and type of bonds.
It's not.
It would sound a lot better.
It makes me happy.
But we need to rank order this.
We need to rank order this.
A lone pair is right there.
A non-bonding pair, a lone pair, an LP.
Nothing but fun.
I could have one lone pair.
And this will all make a lot of sense.
I'm going to start with this.1.
I did it.
Now two, I've got two electron pairs.
OK, and they're both bonding.
Both are BP.
There's just no other way about it.
I've only got two electron domains.
I've got no lone pairs.
So two bonding domains, two electron domains.
That's the only way I can go.
It is in this case.
OK.
Good.
One lone pair, no.
There's only two atoms.
That's kind of the simplest case.
We won't really talk about that.
Good.
It looks more complicated.
I've got some BPs.
In VSEPR, we have to pick an atom.
We're doing this around an atom.
VSEPR applies around an atom.
That doesn't matter for the shape around carbon.
No lone pairs, two electron domains.
Good.
OK.
OK, so that's what they're going to do.
And that is called trigonal planar.
They're going to go at angles like that.
Fine.
There's still only three.
Trigonal planar.
The structure that the molecule takes if there is no LPs is also trigonal planar. That's
formaldehyde.
There's no lone pairs.
If I go to two, I've got three bonding pairs and zero lone pairs.
And there's four.
That's the fourth part of the recipe.
This just goes with what I wrote here.
And this molecule will bend.
It bends the shape.
OK.
And there's another example of that that we could do.
And that is if we had the lone pair, which is what I mentioned before.
I see this.
I did.
Bond order is important, but it is not under one lone pair.
It is not under one lone pair.
Sorry about that.
Bond O.
I should have just kept this.
I go back to this as my key.
OK.
You can't share this moment on Instagram.
We can smell about 10,000 different smells.
It's remarkable.
A dog can smell between 10 and 100,000 times more.
A dog can see about 3,000 miles.
It's the same chemistry in the key.
That is literally how our receptor cells work for taste and smell.
I don't know.
I would get happy with cheese.
But it's shape dependent.
You've got these taste buds.
There's a blow up of it.
And what happens when they get in there.
You live.
That's how he imagined.
That's handedness.
It's pretty cool.
OK.
They can be messed around.
They can be messed around.
And H.
OK.
And NH3. This is how I drew it on the first slide.
It's identical.
OK, so there is zero, one, and two.
Good.
There's just this lone pair pushing down.
And that is back to the same name, which is bent.
I've got a different number of electron domains, but I wind up with the same molecular shape.
But I want to tell you about a labeling system that's actually really helpful.
That's this.
And that's how you can figure out what shape it is, trigonal pyramidal.
But we need a system to name this.
And so the chemists have brilliantly come up with AXE.
X and E.
That's what that means.
I could go back as SO2.
I did erase SO2.
Happiness.
SO2 would be AX2E.
Those are really important, those names of the molecular shape.
This is what happens when you have five electron pair domains.
I want you to really kind of get a feeling for why this works.
OK.
They're on the outside.
I'm picking one atom.
A is S.
That's a terrible rendition of this notation.
I'm going to try one more time.
That looks pretty good.
It's the lone pair.
This has three, one, two, and three.
This has two.
This is a happier structure.
You're using VSEPR.
You're applying these principles.
