PROPROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: Ladies and gentlemen, the
0:10
engineers drinking song.
0:37
It's an interesting song because there are an infinite
0:39
number of verses.
0:41
Here's the mathematical proof.
1:05
I like to build stuff.
1:07
I build stuff out of wood.
1:09
I build stuff out of metal.
1:10
I build stuff out of rocks.
1:12
And I especially like to write programs.
1:23
I've always been mystified by that.
2:44
It's more the other kinds of stuff.
3:07
Not bad.
3:07
How about B6 on B3?
3:18
This program's kind of clever.
3:56
OK.
4:23
Oh, I see.
4:25
My touch pad accidentally got activated.
4:27
B1 on B2.
4:58
OK.
5:11
Let's see.
6:08
Yeah.
7:52
It has to find space on the target block.
7:57
It has to grasp the block that it's been commanded to move.
9:26
It's extremely simple.
9:53
Here's B1.
9:58
Here's BY.
10:03
And the task is to put B1 on B2.
10:19
We have to find space.
10:25
We have to grasp B1.
11:19
This is clearing the top of B1, and this is
11:23
getting rid of BX.
11:26
And the way we get rid of BX is by putting BX on the table.
12:59
OK, so that's how it deals with why questions.
15:49
But I could still answers questions about behavior.
18:05
You think it's going to be complicated.
18:28
The rule-based expert systems were developed in a burst of
18:35
enthusiasm about the prospects for commercial applications of
18:38
artificial intelligence in the mid-1980s.
19:19
I'm going to work out an example having to do with
19:21
identification.
19:31
It was developed to diagnose bacterial
19:34
infections in the blood.
20:39
Has claws.
20:45
Sharp teeth.
21:04
And these are all characteristics of carnivores.
21:44
Let's see how our program would figure that out.
24:51
They're not equipped with anything you might want to
24:53
call common sense.
25:11
And this one works forward from the facts we give it to
25:18
the conclusion off on the right.
25:43
Right.
26:03
And we already know that you can answer questions about
26:05
your own behavior if you leave behind a trace of a goal tree.
26:10
So look at this.
27:25
And I'm going to approach this zoo in a little different way.
30:42
See, in fact world, in deduction world, you're
30:45
talking about proving things.D. thesis.
32:09
He was interested in the architecture of a Portuguese
32:13
architect named Siza.D.
34:01
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: Lisa.
34:34
Large items in the bottom.
34:36
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: Large items in the bottom.
34:44
So if large, then bottom.
34:59
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: If small, then on top.
35:09
So if heavy greater than three, then new bag, or
35:14
something like that.
35:28
Yeah.
35:28
It's outsourced to the customers.
35:32
SPEAKER 7: So no squishies on the bottom.
35:38
Tomatoes.
36:12
They're just taking it up one level of abstraction.
36:16
Not a genius.
36:21
Amazing people.
37:22
We don't have a definition for squishy.
37:27
And no one talked about the motor oil.
38:05
Heuristic number one, specific cases.
38:34
They're both peas.
39:43
All right.
42:46
For example, we talk about a rule, we could talk about a
42:50
rule that knows that you should put the potato chips on
42:53
the top of the bag.
44:36
MIT.
44:38
Guest.
44:39
Yeah, that's me.
44:53
Sounds good.
45:32
I'll get rid of the text box.
45:35
And we'll get rid of those changes scale a little bit.
45:44
You're MIT students.
45:56
And it's going to go along like this.
46:18
That's it.
46:19
Read that.
46:28
It takes about five seconds to read this story.
46:35
For one thing, it says that Duncan is murdered.
46:42
Duncan is murdered by Macbeth.
48:38
In fact, Hamlet and Macbeth are very alike in their plot.
49:12
So look at that.
