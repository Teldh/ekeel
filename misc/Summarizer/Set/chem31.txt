Woo.
Bronsted-Lowry.
It's proton transfer.
It's totally general.
OK, Lewis acids and bases are all about the electrons.
Now hair is very much affected by the softness of water.
That's not a good thing.
We have calcium carbonate, calcium carbonate.
That's what you want to do here.
That's how you soften water. We say et cetera.
And that's where you get this continuous spectrum and that limit of how much of that type of X-ray
you get.
And it just depends on the incident, on the voltage, on the maximum incident electron you fire at it.
Good.5.
Lambda equals 1.
I didn't even need the peak.
d equals 2.
No.38 Angstroms.
Good.
I'm given instead just two theta values.
Those are the different kinds of defects we've talked about for point defects.
In an ionic crystal, you've got to keep charge.
This is an important picture.
Schottky remove, Frenkel move.
That's exciting.
I'm going to start over.
It's the only way to do it.
So one thing I want to make clear, the fraction of vacancies.
We talked about this.
That makes a lot of sense.
It's simply two equations, where a bunch of stuff cancels.
You have two temperatures and a whole bunch of stuff can cancel, and you can figure out then the
activation energy which doesn't change.3 electron volts.
We just did this.
We talked about that.
That's that linear part, that first part.
Right?
OK.
It's going to crack before doing anything.
That's how it all started.
It didn't find the lattice structure.
This is just temperature.
You could also imagine if you cut the pasta, you change the viscosity.
OK.
These come from experiments.
You don't have to get everything right to get a lot of points.
OK.
You integrate it.
We love linear.
OK.
That precipitates, because it forms a solid BaSO4.
OK.
Defects are gone.
That was painful.
We did water.
We did pH.7 times 10 to the minus 3 moles per liter.
OK.
You've got two days.
