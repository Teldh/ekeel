And that is super exciting.
And Dalton did a lot of really important experiments.
And it's going to react fully.
There's no excess.
And you react some amount.
And some amount of something else.
But he had some amount of something.
Aha.33.
I measure it.33 reacts fully.
And he'd find that this same ratio was 1 to 2.66.
And he noticed a pattern.
And he noticed a pattern.
2.66 divided by 1.
These things would happen in integer ratios, integer amount.
That frustrated him.
But he did come up with these symbols.
But that wasn't his real problem.
His real problem was what I just alluded to.
He was so close.
He was so close.
But he did have this nice ability to see these series.
OK.
I can measure the volumes.
And I do this for the cases where there's nothing left over, nothing limited it.
He would find that you've got for every two volumes of hydrogen gas-so you've got two volumes of
hydrogen that he would react with one volume of oxygen.
Everything is accounted for.
Lavoisier holds-conservation of mass.
One volume of hydrogen, and one volume of chlorine would give you two volumes of hydrogen and
chlorine-something that had hydrogen and chlorine in it.
And you'd get two.
You add one volume.
And it would feel like it was reduced.
This is what they were grappling with.
This is where they were.
And he made a critical proposal.
And I think if you've had high school chemistry, you know what this is.
This is important.
He was flexible.
It doesn't work.
I can't make enough water.
I just can't make enough particles. It's got to add up.
Counting has to work.
That's the only way the numbers work.
Dalton didn't buy it.
You've got leeks, dude.
And he really was harsh.
I block you on Instagram.
OK.
That's what his constant does for us.
You must.
Avogadro didn't come up with this number.022 times 10 to
the 23rd.
It's just a number.
But it's a really important one because it provides the link.
It's 12.
How many bags of sugar are there in a dozen bags of sugar?
It's 12.
That's all it is.
So a mole of one atom will have a different amount of mass, a different weight than a mole of
another atom.
I'm not going to count them.5 grams.
I have 1,000 pennies.
OK.
And this is critical.
OK.
The mass of the atom and the grams per mole are the same number.011 AMU.
These are atomic mass units.011 grams.
Numbers of atoms, mass per atom.
We don't need to know.
This comes from weighing neutrons and protons.
This is where you get that information.7 grams.
And I can look up how many grams of mole hydrogen weighs.
And that's how many grams I get.
One mole of it is that.
The link is coming.
It's very exciting.25 moles.
I know how many moles of candle I've got.
It's just a number.
In one minute.
It says in one minute.
I'm just taking the information I was given.
And I'm using the math of minutes and hours.
So 1/720th of the candle burns.
In one minute, 1/720 of the candle burns.003.
No, 0347 moles.
A mole is just a number.
I figured out how much candle I had.
In grams, that gave me how many moles I have of candle.
That's what we do.
And I always like to give you guys advice if I can.
It's noisy.
You want to talk.
You want a quieter room.
And it's quiet so you can talk. So 38 times as many O2.9 grams of oxygen per minute.
You need that.4 grams of O2 is burned per minute.
And I'm not saying that everyone's going to understand this.
And this gets me to the other topic of conversation that you can have.
And this gets me to my why this matters moment for today.
And N2 is one of the strongest bonds in nature.
And plants can't break it.
Balancing and mole ratio's the same-counting.
But balancing is counting.
OK, that helps me with the nitrogen.
I meant to put that in the first place.
But it took tremendous amounts of energy.
And Haber-Bosch came up with a way using catalysis to do it at much lower temperatures.
Catalysis is something we'll learn later in the semester.
One mole of ammonia is 17 grams.
I need that much tons of NH3 per year.
I know how many atoms we're talking about in one mole.
This is how many moles I needed per year.
We know how much the atmosphere weighs.4 times
10 to the 20th moles of N2.
That's good.
And you can work backwards.
And you can learn that you're good.
There's no H2 in the atmosphere.
It's in the oceans.
You run out of N2-plenty of H2 left.
I like to throw stuff like T-shirts.
We're working on discovering new ones.
By 1799, we had 34.
That was cool for three times.
And it sort of also only worked for 2 and 1/2 runs.
And many people took a stab at it.
they were looking for periodicity.
And what he figured out was absolutely critical.
This is oriented differently than what we do today.
But it's OK.
He had 63 elements.
And this is so important-properties.
That was new.
This doesn't have the right properties.
And you measure those properties.
This is a big deal.
It really brings us to the current system that we use.
Our periodic table today is based Mendeleev's organization.
And we're going to be spending a lot of time with it.
But a couple of things.
It should have a key.
That looks nice.
You have a mole, that's how many grams you have.
This is your periodic table.
It's all in the key.
But it's all in the key.
It's all described in the key.
But it's all in the key.
Some of these we know like the weight-atomic weight-that's what we've been talking about.
But it's all on the key.
You never know when you need it.
You never know.
Students do this.
I love it.
You don't have to send me pictures.
You never know.
I think it's being used as a pillow.
You might need this.
You don't know.
You don't know.
We just built it up.
The first things is just some nomenclature.
They go right there.
These are called the actinides.
OK.
There's only two rows in the periodic table that are actually 18.
And those top ones are called mean group.
These ones are transition elements.
And that is super exciting.
And Dalton did a lot of really important experiments.
And it's going to react fully.
