None the game playing programs today incorporate any of that
3:38
kind of stuff.
4:16
It doesn't try anything.
4:32
Here are the possible moves.
4:58
It's not very powerful.
5:59
In the end, there are lots of features of the chessboard.
6:08
And we might form some function of those features.
6:25
Each of those produces a number fed into this function,
6:28
out comes a value.
7:02
And that is a linear scoring polynomial.
7:36
It doesn't have to rank them.
7:38
It doesn't have to give them numbers.
7:46
But it's not the only way of doing that.
8:28
You do 50 things.
8:29
I do 50 things.
9:50
It's just b to the d.
10:32
It's pretty deep down there.
11:38
It used to seem impossible.
13:12
14.7 billion.
13:26
That's 10 to the 10th years.
13:50
Multiply it times the number of atoms in the universe.
14:08
It would have to harness together lots of universes.
14:35
No good.
18:51
It's very simple.
19:15
But this is an adversarial game.
19:33
There's a game tree.
19:34
Do you see how it goes?
19:38
Let's see if the system can figure it out.
20:22
Those are just random numbers.
20:43
It's exponential.
21:59
I've got the same structure in the tree.
22:10
But none of the static values have been computed yet.
23:44
So, one more time.
24:13
It doesn't matter.
24:41
It's minimax with a flourish.
24:57
And it is.
27:21
And this value is now exactly 7.
28:15
Think about that for a while.
28:56
This is called deep cut off.
30:48
We already know.
30:49
They're alpha and beta.
31:25
Let's see what happens when we use the classroom example, the
31:29
one I did up there.
31:45
2, same answer.
32:00
And it's not the smallest number.
33:40
It saves an amazing amount of time.
35:02
That's not very good.
35:18
It's a binary game tree.
35:23
This is level d minus 1.
35:26
And this is level d.
35:58
And there are b to d of those.
40:59
That's the dead horse we don't want to beat.
42:11
It's something you layer on top of minimax.
42:26
That's right.
42:32
It's not an approximation.
42:35
It cuts off lots of the tree.
42:36
It's a dead horse principle at work.
46:11
We're competing with another manufacturer.
46:47
It's substituting raw power for sophistication.
47:33
But it's not our intelligence.
47:34
It's bulldozer intelligence.1.
