You know why you're so excited?
Because it's a goody bag day.
But I didn't want to wait.
There's diamond, silicon, germanium, copper.
And we talked about insulators, semiconductors.
That's in your goody bag.
We talked a lot about semiconductors.
It can be filled here.
That's what this is.
There is no gap.
You can't define a gap in a metal.
And we talked about semi-conductor problems.
2.8 centimeters cubed of pure germanium.6 times 10 to the 20th per centimeter
cubed.
N-type.
OK.
That's where they can carry electricity.
That's actually a pretty good way to name them.
I didn't do anything to the material.
I added dopants.
Those are extrinsically doped.
I want to talk about metals.
There's aluminum.
There's aluminum.
And there is aluminum.
They're loose.
Everything is determined by where these electrons are.
That comes next week.
They are truly free.
And this is really the picture of the metallic bond.
They've lost it.
Those outer ones have gone.
And we're going to finish what we started.
We're going to finish what we started.
We talked about ionic.
You have a maybe HH.
So every ion has this kind of ocean of electrons around it.
They're not attached.
It doesn't matter.
Another kid's going to come into my backyard at some point, so it's all good.
I don't know what's going on.
No.
One of them just took the kid.
I'm going too far.
They're roaming around.
They're roaming around.
I'm going to finish that table.
We started the table.
It's a big range.
We'll talk about that.
And there is an example, iron.
We finished our table.
That's it.
That's the last entry.
That's what I want to talk about.
They are reflective.
They're shiny.
There are literally settings in like photo apps.
They have luster.
They have a high thermal conductivity.
High heat capacity.
They're malleable and ductile.
OK.
There's no gap.
There's no gap.
OK.
I've got electrons.
I shine photons on these.
There's no gap.
Diamond has a gap of 5.
It's of course, the electrons.
You have to shine a very high energy photon to excite an electron in diamond.
When you go to the store to buy diamonds, you should ask them about the electrons.
It comes from the sea.
It comes from the sea.
I'm stuck in this full valence band.
I got nowhere to go.
Sorry.
You could spend hours on this.
I do spend hours on this.
You just click around.
And this is a really high set of elements.
Screening.
Really free s-electrons.
High conductivity.
OK.
It's totally different.
That's temperature.
Relativity.
You can't do that with very many properties.
And I'm not going to go into those details.
I just want to mention it.
Thermal divided by electrical conductivity for both-conductivities-OK, I'm putting it in parentheses.
Alloy.
Alloy.
These are all-alloy.
That is done for metals in a very wide range.
What does that mean?
We'll see in 10 minutes.
Malleable, ductile.
Brass.
That is how you know someone.
And this is really how we think about materials design.
The conductivity drop even more.
It's not so simple.
This is just a preview.
Interstitial.
This is just a preview.
Substitution, interstitial.
In this case, I really like iron.
It's really cheap.
And that's called steel.
This was just literally yesterday.
Newest alloy.
OK.
This looks like a minute long.
That's an ionic crystal.
In contrast, if you hit a metal with a hammer, it doesn't break.
It just dents.
The most malleable metal is gold.
We call this ductility.
Ionic compounds are not ductile for the same reason they are not malleable in general.
In contrast, a metal can be pulled into a long cylindrical shape because the cations can line up as the fluid-like like sea of electrons flows around them.
That's my favorite part.
The most ductile metal.
What is it?
We may never know.
OK.
OK.
Sea of electrons.
I'm just saying.
The metal bond is not so directional.
It doesn't break.
So wire-pulling-check this one out.
You can take a 10-centimeter by one-centimeter platinum rod, and you can spin that into a wire, and
this is done-this is a very thin case for effect.0006-millimeter diameter wire, and you get 2,777 kilometers of wire.
This transformation elongates the wire.
One meter of 5.5-millimeter wire rod can be drawn to 30 meters with one millimeter diameter or 484
meters with 0.25 millimeters diameter.
OK.
This is just one of them.
This is the same factory.
Now these things here are doing the opposite.
It counts how many electrons are in an anti-bonding orbital.
Some of them may not.
The bonding got stronger.
It's the same thing.
You have a band.
This is not electroconductivity.
No tricks.
And the melting point of cesium is 28 degrees C.
And it all has to do with how these electrons are filling the metallic bands. I just want
to make one more point.
I can't stop because there is one more thing I want to show very quickly in one minute.
And we talked about that.
I've got eight electrons, eight-electron capacity in that band per atom.
And for magnesium, I'm going to fill it with two electrons.
OK.
