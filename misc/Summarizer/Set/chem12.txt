We're going to move on today.
When I was talking about this I tried to put two different concepts in the same place.
And people corrected me.
And we had the case of SO2.
Both of these molecules, when you're thinking about VSEPR, the number of electron domain count--
Right.
And we did this on Wednesday.
OK.
But I was also telling you about repulsion order at the same time.
OK.
The number of lone pairs.
And so this shape is called bent.
But you make mistakes.
You do your best.
That's all you can ever do.
I said bent.
I said the word bent.
But that shape is not bent.
That shape is trigonal planer.
And it's a little bit distorted.
OK.
This shape is bent.
But it's also a little bit distorted.
OK.
There's trigonal planar.
there's bent.
OK.
Good.
But this tells me that there's electrons on the bond.
It tells me that there's electrons really localized in the region between the atoms.
Yep.
Sharing is caring.
I've got the two protons.
And we talked about these.
A repulsion.
And then the two electrons.
Repulsion.
And each electron sees both of them.
And this is where those electrons are.
And the electron is in this probability cloud around both of them.
That's the molecular orbital.
And Lewis can't tell us about that.
OK.
Molecular orbital.
Right?
OK.
Combinations of the AOs.
LCAO.
Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals.
OK.
And in particular, sum and difference of orbitals is what we're about.
These are waves.
These are waves.
And that's what we're going to explore in MO theory.
This is not a charge.
These are just waves.
Waves.
The p orbital has a plus and a minus.
Right?
OK.
And I can add it. Or I can subtract it.
OK.
I might actually get something like this.
Because I've just subtracted the same amount.
And I've created two MOs.
That's about the simplest thing you can do in MO theory.
OK.
Because these are just the orbitals.
I got to do something with them.
That got me excited.
But you can see right here.
Or antibonding.
This would be antibonding.
And you can see why this is antibonding.
I made these with 1s.
They're actually less bonding.
They're antibonding.
Those are my AOs.
AO, AO.
And the way we refer to the antibonding orbital is with a little star.
OK.
I used two AOs.
I added and subtracted them.
I got two MOs.
That's good.
It makes a lot of sense.
I got to have room for four.
Two here.
Two here.
They must obey Pauli.
You can't mess with quantum mechanics.
They're still electrons.
They're still quantum mechanical.
OK.
And one more thing.
Hund.
But we will.
OK.
And we'll see how that goes.
OK.
OK.
That's it.
OK.
There's a way of understanding bond strength.
And that is a very important concept.
OK.
But I don't know if that's a good idea.
OK.
And there's a definition for this.
It's going to equal 1/2 of the number of electrons in a bonding orbital, minus the number of electrons
in an antibonding orbital.
Sorry.
But we'll do a bunch of them so you can see what this means.
I don't feel like writing it out.
OK.
Good.
It's 1/2.
That's good.
And in this case, energy is always going up in these diagrams.
There's no charge to the system.
And so now different quantum numbers.
Pauli.
But same sigma.
But you know what's coming.
I've got three electrons.
They're going to go here.
Here the bond order is zero.
Because you're putting just as much charge on this thing that wants to bond it as you are on this thing
that doesn't want to bond it.
And at the end of the day, it leads to a molecule that is not stable.
OK.
OK.
That's not my example.
And we're populating it with one electron.
This is just like SPD.
Sigma 1s.
Sigma 1s star.
OK.
Good.
But we're going to move on-don't worry-from sigma.
OK.
Oh-ho.
2s.
Lithium brings this.
What does it bring?
It brings three electrons.
But I want to make an important point.
OK.
The reason is because it's related to the overlap.
Those are molecular.
They're kind of close to the core.
OK.
These sigma 1ses-oh, sigma 1s.
Sigma 2s.
Sigma 2s.
Sigma 2s.
OK.
Bond order.
So the lithium dimer bonding order is 1.
OK.
But you could spend the whole night.
After I watch Dr.
It's finite.
It's not going to take forever.
OK.
OK.
And I'm going to add it to a p orbital that looks like this.
They're both along the axis.
One.
Zero.
And this is minus.
I had nodes in the original orbitals.
And the other thing we see about this is that it is symmetric around that bonding axis.
OK.
I don't know.
OK.
I'll take that.
And so the density goes down.
But I've reduced the electron density.
No probability density there.
OK.
Sigma star pz.
By the way, some textbooks.
We're adding and subtracting.
We're constructively interfering and destructively interfering.
But it's the same thing.
That's what we're doing.
OK.
But that's why we have another symbol for them.
I have three orbitals.
One, I put it along the axis.
And this is one of them.
I'll show it to you.
They're not saying what molecule this is yet.
This is a 2p orbital.
Good.
There's a pi orbital.
And you get the same exact effect.
And that's what it looks like for the pi orbital. OK.
It's not really involved in the bonding.
I'm going to leave it out.
OK.
Good.
And we know that they are all filled.
OK.
And I'm not.
Those are 2s.
Those are 2s.
Sigma 2s.
Sigma star 2s.
OK.
Good.
That was close.
px, py, pz.
And there is oxygen.
And they form these MOs.
And we just went over what types they are.
And there's a sigma M.
This delta is up there.
The pis are inside.
Pi px, pi py.
All looking like the shapes that we've been drawing.
I've got the valence filling for oxygen.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Pauli.
Pauli.
It's a double bond.
Lewis could have gotten us this.
But Lewis can't get us magnetism.
Lewis can't get us magnetism.
OK.
And I pour it through a huge magnet.
Liquid nitrogen just goes right on through.
That's liquid nitrogen. Liquid oxygen.
There's four more things we've got to cover.
One is paramagnetism.
Another is what happens when you go hetero nuclear.
You will feel a force from that magnetic field.
What's happening?
I can tell you why that experiment happens.
Paramagnetism.
This is diamagnetism.
But you still feel a little repulsion to a magnetic field.
Because water is diamagnetic.
It looked sort of OK.
So the frog was floating.
And it was like a study about levitation using magnetism.
It's like it's sophisticated.
I pour it through a colander.
You did use a membrane.
You did a filter.
I could have.
I've accomplished the same exact thing.
I have separated the pasta from the water.
Test done.
Pasta may not taste as good.
Gazuntite.
And this is how we do chemistry.
It's a big pasta cooker.
40% of that is for this one thing.
It's boiling pasta.
But the pasta is 1 nanometer to 10 nanometer particles.
40% goes into boiling one chemical species off of another.
Separation.
Separation.
Desalination.
And there's a really simple reason.
We don't have the right pasta colander.
There's no option for that size scale that can withstand the conditions that are in all of those chemical
separations.
We need O2.
But we don't want the N2.
And this is how much energy it takes.
OK.
But I had some other-paramagnetism.
Unpaired electrons. Sigma.
Sigma S. Sigma.
Sigma star.
Pi.
Pi star.
You see.
I'm throwing more orbitals into the mix.
And they're closer.
They switch.
It's real.
They switch.
But it is important.
And those happen below O2.
Sigma.
Same symmetry.
You see that?
That's an important effect.
OK.
But it only happens below O2.
OK.
But Cl is bringing all of the-it's bringing S. It's bringing P.
