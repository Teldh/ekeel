We've done a lot of work on ionic bonds.
Sure.
And that's the ionic bond.
And we learned this.
Because they get closer.
You're repelling me.
You're repelling me.
We'll share.
They're happier because they got two positive charges that they can kind of go around and be near.
This is covalent.
This is covalent.
We write it with a dash.
OK.
That's hydrogen. I forget.
Six!
Six.
OK.
That is where Lewis will help.
And the recipe is written here.
That's OK.
I will write one through six for the example.
I will parallel that recipe.
So the first step is connect atoms.
OK.
That means that they're on the outside.
Terminal.
OK?
Outside.
They're also called terminal.
OK.
So two.
I've got eight valence electrons.
Good.
OK.
Place bonding pair of electrons.
Two electrons in a bonding pair.
OK.
I can do that. Right?
OK.
I put two electrons.
Hydrogen doesn't want eight.
Hydrogen just wants two.
Two for hydrogen. OK.
They're sharing.
Atoms.
OK.
It has two.
Next one.
OK.
I went from the outside in.
H has two.
H has two.
That's good.
I had a total number of electrons.
OK.
And those are called non-bonding.
Because they're not bonding.
They're not involved in a bond.
I don't want to deal with it.
So six is not needed.
It's got its octet.
We'll go faster now.
In this case, H2O.
But shapes come later.
OK.
Good.
Place bonding pair of electrons between adjacent atoms.
OK.
OK.
This can count those two electrons.
You see how this works?
Because we're sharing now.
No one took.
We're sharing.
How many do I have left?
I've got 12 left.
It's perfect.
Cl has all of these.
It got an extra electron.
I used the extra electrons.
If electrons are left over-No electrons left over.
So five and six are not needed.
Last example.
O-C, example C.
I don't even want to hint at it.
Those are my atoms.
I've got two hydrogens, an oxygen, and a chlorine.
OK.
I'm sorry, a carbon.
Two hydrogens, an oxygen, and carbon.
OK.
Their terminally oxygen is outside, carbons in the middle.
OK.
OK?
Good.
OK.
OK.
It's two.
But what about oxygen?
OK.
It looks like oxygen needs some.
And I created a stronger sharing bond.
That's cool.
It's the same thing.
Everybody's happy.
Caring is sharing.
They're all sharing.
In this case, it's formaldehyde.
OK.
CH2O.
These are not done.
But it's like my starting place.
OK.
Carbon central here.
H-Let me see here.
Or I could draw it like this.
All right?
Like this.
It all works out.
The total number of valence electrons is 12 in both cases, and everybody's obeying the octet rule.
Bonding electrons are divided equally.
Oxygen, six.
That means the atom, before it ever participated in a bond, minus the number of dots, minus the
number of lines.
Or the total number of electrons involved in bonds divided by two.
And that's our guideline.
I've got two Lewis structures and they look like they both satisfy the recipe.
The recipe is satisfied.
It's not obvious.
It has to do with its vibrations.
Right?
This one.
OK.
Each electron sees both of those protons.
Practice makes perfect.
OK.
Electronegativity.
All right?
In a bond.
Right?
Like the size of an atom.
I want to quantify this.
I'll tell you why that word polar is there in a few minutes.
And so Pauling developed this scale-the electronegativity scale-to tell us this.
And he arbitrarily set fluorine to four and hydrogen at first 2.2.
There are actually many electronegativity scales.
When you're talking to these elements you want them to feel good.
They're very important.
They have the same kai.
And it's 2.23, which is pretty high.
And it's ionic.
But here delta kai is equal to 0.96.
This bond is not purely covalent because one of them took a little more charge, because it's
electronegativity was higher.
And in-between it depends.
Sodium bromide.
It's not on there.9.7.
That is why it's called polar covalent.
Where Q is that the charge.
In this case, it's literally the charge that was pulled.
And this is just one debye.3.36 angstroms.
And in fact, you might see it written like this.3 times 10 to the minus 19th coulombs.
This is almost there.
It's something like 80% of an electron.
In reality, we've been talking about absolutes.
I fully took a charge.
You took 80%.
They're still acting like covalent molecules.
