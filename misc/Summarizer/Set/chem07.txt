I want to start right where we left off.
We've done a lot of work to know what it is that we're filling.
And we talked about the four quantum numbers.
And we're going to fill electrons into atoms.
They're shielded.
That's called orbital penetration.
And that's why these things split up.
It's not.
But it's not.
That was that orbital penetration, the peak that you saw on Monday.
Those are also the ground state.
OK.
This is sort of related to the distance from the nucleus.
This is the principle quantum number.
I forgot my r.
Lower n filled first.
OK.
This is n.
This is l.
OK.
You're done with that orbital, because I've got two electrons.
They do have different quantum numbers.6 electron volts.6 good for hydrogen.
Those are-that's how you would see these atoms in terms of the filling of the electrons into their
orbitals.
Good.
That is correct.
It's got six electrons that it can take.
OK.
It is the same sub shell.
I'm saying opposite things.
2p, 2p.
Shell, sub shell.
That's how you fill them.
They want a lot of things, electrons.
They need their space.
That's not a lot of things.
It's two things.
But that's what they want.
They're all filled.
That's electrons.
It's so important that I went all caps.
Whereas the core electrons are kind of mostly inert.
The valence for lithium and the valence for sodium look really similar.
But the valence looks very similar, one electron in an s orbital.
OK.
That means lower energy for the whole system.
So anomalies happen.
We got filling.
It's a beautiful thing.
It was arranged.
That's why these are 14.
It's not that these don't have p electrons in them.
That's why they're here.
We now know so much more.
And we'll be making those connections.
We'll be making those connections a lot.
The one connection I'll tell you about today has to do with diameter.
OK.
And a couple of things.
The argon ones are even closer.
Those 1s electrons are not screened.6.
But there's two protons.
For helium, it's 24.5 eV.6.
That's where it sits.5 eV.
I can't-this is 1s.
These are calculated.
But we can also calculate them.
And that's why these are calculated atomic radii.
And we understood this arrow that the radii get larger as you go down the periodic table.
If I go from hydrogen to lithium, I add protons.
But I shield those protons with electrons.
OK, so that's lithium.
They are screened by the 1s orbital.
They're only screened by these two electrons.
So the additional positive charge wins.
I told you about the disco and the periodic table.
OK, so dance pairs are happy.
I'm happier closer in.
Who's there?
And there's only one person, because these two people are totally occupied.
That's not cool.
But there's four people in the middle.
That wasn't like a move.
I don't know what that was.
Abbreviations.
It's going to lose-remember we talked about the first ionization potential.
We talked about that last week.
You can also lose more than that.
They're different atoms.
Those are called isoelectronic.
OK, and I can ask question.
And I can mix it up.
And we're doing this for a reason.
Sodium is one of them.
I'm good.
But we will.
We will ionize those next week.
You have a scale.
That's not-no.
It's in here somewhere.
This is incredible.
OK, so that's good.
You don't know.
People talk about electrolytes.
They talk a big game.
When atoms react they will gain or lose.
We just talked about how you use the noble gas notation-did I just erase it?
I did.
And it's ionic.
It's ionic.
We just made our first bond.
What do I want to say?
I want to talk about that attraction.
Because that's actually attraction that we know very well.
That's it.
I don't like that.
That's called the lattice energy.
There's sodium chloride.
There's magnesium oxide.
And you can see trends.
We just talked about these.
It likes to get close to the nearest noble gas.
You can look that up.
That's what that's related to.
You've got a scale.
You've got a scale.
But people traveled like that.
We've learned.
These are lattice energies.
OK, so we can isolate it down to one bond or a mole of bonds.
That's why aluminum is in your toothpaste.
Aluminum oxide is in your toothpaste.
It's in your pans.
It's in sandpaper.
It is a very hard material.
It is a very hard material.
It devastates their weekly schedule.
You're filtering toxins out of the blood.
