Happy Friday.
Cool.
I am excited.
We're going to keep talking about XRD today.
We're going to pick up where we left off.
We were here.
And in particular, this is a pretty nice image.
Now a second one doesn't bounce off that top surface.
It bounces off of the one beneath it.
So these black atoms are one plane.
And we say it's reflecting off the mirror.
And that's if this distance plus that distance is equal to a multiple of the wavelength.
They've gone the same distance.
Everything else is destructive.
No signal.
But we did one more thing.
We also said that d for some set of planes.
I'm going to pick one of these planes.
And the distance between them is DHKL.
Bragg plus distance Miller.
Right?
Miller cubic.
That's what we're really combining here.
And we talked about constance.
That's some good math.54 angstroms.54.
It's called a target because you're targeting it with electrons.
So the copper target, k alpha, lambda constant.
Constant.
Constant equals the angle and the plane it's reflecting off.
And that's where we left off.
This is what happens when you don't have any money.
We don't need fancy equipment at MIT.
I like the way that looks.
Same thing.
Right?
Source.
Sample.
Detector.
OK.
But you might keep the source x-rays fixed.
You're keeping this fixed.
I got aluminum.
And I shot x-rays.
At some point, you got to know this.
This is pretty important.54 angstroms.
And I'm being asked to get the crystal structure of aluminum and the lattice constant.
2 theta.
Peak 1, 2, 3, 4.
Sin squared of half of that.
Gesundheit.
It's just easier.
I'm just going to divide everything by that.33.67.67.
But I don't want fractions.
How about 3 times 3.
In this case, times 3 equals 3.
Times 3.
I'm clearing the fractions for the whole table.
I'm multiplying by the same number.
8.
And that's what I need to work with.
That works.
And for 4, 2 0 0.
I've gone from angles to planes.
These are planes.
It means one of those.
OK.
OK.
You got to remember the selection rules.
Anything.
And for bcc, it adds to an even number.
And for FCC, no mixing.
Odd.
And I can go even further.
I can calculate the lattice constant.
It's right here.
And that's actually the last step in the recipe.
X-ray defractioners.
That's OK.
We'll make it work.
You're X-ray diffractioners.
That's it.
This is a very powerful tool.
And it is used all over the place in materials chemistry, physics.
We have achieved our goal.
With great power comes great responsibility.
How you use XRD.
How you use XRD.
Worry about hcp. bcc.
This is called a phase diagram.
I'm kidding.
So the crystal structure of something-in this case, it's iron-depends on the pressure and
temperature.
And the properties depend on the crystal structure.
Same element.
I'm just changing its structure.
I love this one.
This is water.
There are 17 current phases of ice.
17 different crystalline structures of ice.
That is incredible.
And they do.
Now Earth's operating conditions are right around here.
And the ice wouldn't float to the top.
You freeze from the top.
We can figure out.
OK.
It also depends on its shape.
OK.
It's 38 degrees.
38 degrees.
OK.
Lambda equals to d sine theta.
This corresponds to a plane.
So some distance between some planes corresponds to some angle that gave me constructive
interference for those planes.
They're beautiful things.
And you want to find those.37 angstroms.
OK.
But I'm very close.
Lattice constant.
Distance between any planes.1 angstroms.
FCC.
Automic radius.
Which one is it?
It's gold.
It's gold.
You have the power to do this.
You can go back and forth based on your knowledge of crystals and your knowledge
of x-rays.
And I will talk about that.
There's the k alpha for copper.
20 to 30.
He did more.
38 in total.
So Moseley came up with-he was working on this in 1912.
1912 was when Rutherford did the gold foil experiments.
That chemical properties.
In ordering of the elements.
Properties win.
Moseley's experiments told us.6 ev.
All that looks familiar.
Times z minus 1 squared.
That's what he did.
And this is 3/4.
So 13.
We've talked about this.
You see it in two ways.
3/4.
And it works.
They see z minus 1 if z is related to the atomic number.
I just want to show you that it is a perfectly straight line.
These are his different elements.
But they didn't know that it was connected to the position in the periodic table.
44 years had come since Mendeleev.
Periodicity is atomic number.
That was not known.
It was a very important discovery.
He died in 1915.
That's how important that discovery was.
OK, zinc melts around 420 C.
Greater than 900 C.
So those electrons are coming off with thousands and thousands of KEV.
The cathode is shaped to focus the electrons onto a small portion of the target, which increases the
intensity of the x-rays produced.
But there's so much energy being pumped into this material.
That metal is getting extremely hot.
It gets a little break.
Or you do both.
But you'll get the zinc lines.
You'll get the zinc lines.
And that was why he used brass.
And that's why you can see you get extra lines in the case of brass.
Al right.
Good!
All right.
I'm changing that.
I'm changing it because properties matter.
And that is why your periodic table is what it is.
Absolutely critical.
It put the lantinides in the right place.
I knew I was talking about Moseley.
OK.
And in the middle.
And this is all for Moseley.
You know, let's share.
Sharing is always caring.
And that was by Van Laway.
These are x-rays.
These are x-ray intensities versus wavelength.
Electrons.
That's thousands of electron volts of the incoming electron.
Right?
OK.
This continuous spectrum.
You can imagine that that could lead to all sorts of interesting cascades of absorption and emission.
That's what leads to this shape.
But we don't need to know those details.
And this goes down.
It's kicking out the 1s electron that gives you characteristic peaks.
Walter and Paul.
They took this continuous spectrum.
I'm not changing the angle.
You get spots.
You have a single crystal.
Theta is fixed.
But lambda varies continuously.
OK.
Pattern reflects the crystal symmetry.
I don't know.
They make different spots.
And that's what those are.
In those spots, it's more complicated to get crystal structure from those spots.
It's more complicated.
But this happened before.
It resolved the structure of zinc sulfide.
It was very important work.
Laue is just on the side for knowledge.
We won't test on this.
This tells you something about crystal symmetry.
That's translational symmetry.
There's no rotational symmetry.
Nobody believed him.
Linus Pauling wrote the book on chemical bonds.
And Linus Pauling took the lead.
He took the lead in attacking Shechtman.
Shechtman had discovered quasi crystals.
His papers weren't published.
And for 10 years, nobody believed him.
And he had his day.
And he was proven right.
And these quasi crystals are absolutely fascinating.
