Welcome, parents.
Welcome, parents.
This is 3091, Introduction to Solid State Chemistry.
And today we're going to have a little bit of fun.
We're going to learn about x-rays today.
But it doesn't even matter.
The first one is staying warm.
And we'll cook.
We'll talk about that.
That's our plan today.
They see C25 H52 combusting.
And they'll make a choice.
They may get you out of the room because you don't know.
And of course, they'll have their periodic tables with them at the dinner.
It's hydrogen.
OK.
But what we're interested in is combustion.
You don't need to light hydrogen on fire to stay warm.
But I also have suggested discussion topics.
You could talk about the concept of a mole.
But we do need to learn what X-rays are.
Because next week, we're going to be shining them on stuff.
So today, we're going to learn about how X-rays are generated.
And it all starts with the very first selfie.
This is it.
That's the very first X-ray ever taken.
That's the very first X-ray ever taken.
And Wilhelm Rontgen was playing around with cathode ray tubes.
I investigated.
But what we do in this class is we investigate.
We're explorers.
And he was in the basement in his lab.
That's him.
We learned a lot about cathode ray tubes.
And we talked about how this led to the discovery of the electron itself.
I'm going to make that some kind of metal, and I'm going to hit the metal with the electrons.
The room glowed.
He really did.
And that stuck.
They're unique because they have very high energy.
They have very high energy.
So the X-ray energies-the energies are in the range of 100 eV to 100 KeV.
That's a big energy.01 and 10 nanometers.
Radium cure, a fad of Paris society.
This is what it says.
December 9th.
The afternoon radium cue is the latest craze in Paris society.
They didn't know.
So the impact of X-rays is tremendous.
No.
That's what they think about.
They can't help it.
They cannot help it.
Chemistry is at the heart of it all.
And we can use chemistry.
Nature does it on this yearly time scale.
OK.
OK.
Nothing is happening.
You've got to keep watching it.
I've got to go and write down those electron levels.
I've got to figure out how that happened.
That's what I did.
And I controlled the kinetics.
Because that's what happened there.
We controlled when it-it didn't happen right away.
It happened later.
We're changing how electrons interact with the material to change the color.
We are painting.
And that's what nature is doing with its leaves.
Some of those parents may have kids that go to the other school.
We do.
We do everything we can.
We did everything right.
I don't know.
It's super high voltage.
And it arises continuous-continuous.
It's a continuous spectrum.
There are two types of X-rays.
This is like that metal atom.
And I've shot really high-energy electrons at it.
But that atom has electrons sitting around it.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
I'm shooting high-energy electrons at this atom.
It didn't interact.
And so the electron curves like that.
This is not a electron stuck in an orbit.
No.
It gives off a photon.
And we know that it's lost energy to the photon.
It's decelerated.
It's decelerated.
It's left with less energy.
And that deceleration emits photons.
They're in this very high-energy range.
But you've got this continuous spectrum.
You can see if I shot it I bump up the voltage even more shooting it with higher-energy electrons.
Incident electron energy.
Continuous x-rays.
OK.
They see it as iron with interstitially doped carbon.
And you take out a hammer because you have a hammer in the closet.
And you go like this.
And nothing happens.
And nothing happens.
Nothing happens.
They've got a lot of power.
I wonder if we could leverage the power of the hydrogen bond.
OK. They knew.
They saw the gecko.
OK.
This is where you talk about things like the crystal structure of iron.
This is where you talk about things like intermolecular forces.
And we've learned them all.
We learned about them all in this class.
Where you talk about the power bonds and the power of the bond between you as a family.
This is it.
OK.
We'll see how that goes.
That's good.
There's another type of X-ray.
And the other type of X-ray-that's the only board left.
The other type of X-ray is from a different phenomenon that also has to do with-it also has to do with
the atom and the electron.
As we've learned in this class, when you go from one area of expertise to another-like
crystallographers don't like commas.
They don't like commas.
It makes no sense.
This is the same thing with X-ray specialists.
So the KLMs there are simply the quantum numbers, the principle quantum numbers.
It's got enough energy to excite it.
This is very different.
It's not continuous.
It feels good.
It feels pretty good.
And the way this works in terms of labeling is because it goes down to the k level, these are k
photons.
And we go in order.
It ended in k.
That's good.
That's great.
It gave off a photon.
This is forbidden.
It's forbidden.
This is second type of X-ray.
OK.
It sounded interesting.
You can't do that.
It's not going to happen.
OK.
Good.
Good.
That's perfect.
And we know about crystals in this glass.
This is quartz.
This is what we know now.
We look at this in this class.
I'm good.
We're good.
That is quartz.
That is quartz.
That's not glass, by the way.
Glass means amorphous.
It means not crystalline.
It means not crystalline.
It's a very strong material.
That's what we're going to study in a couple of weeks in this class.
It's OK.
I need some volunteers.
You don't look quite like a parent, but it's OK.
OK.
This is for aim.
We'll take turns.
We'll take turns.
OK.
OK.
That was good.
Who's next?
I need a volunteer.
And we're going to see if it's a good piece of glass for your phone.
OK?
All right.
That's all right.
Multiple tries.
You've got this.
That's very strong glass.
We might have them reversed.
OK.
No.
But there's a reason for it.
This is tempered.
That means that it's been treated.
You saw that it didn't break.
But the strain builds up.
These peaks only depend on the metal atom.
So Ronten put in a metal, and he'd always get the same peaks if I give it enough energy.
They're called characteristic because they're characteristic of the metal.
I've got a new kind of light that I can shine.
OK.
And I get it all.
But with that new kind of light, I can do new things.
And that's very important.
And that's what we're going to do after the exam, which is on Monday.
The exam.
You've got to think about the exam.
And there's a very important thing that happens when you shine light onto something.
But it depends on the size of the thing they're interacting with.
And it can diffract.
And that allows us to determine the structure of the crystal.
That's called X-ray diffraction.
And this is how it all started.
I'm just saying it's not all about the kids.
And that is one of the most-X-ray diffraction-what we're going to do with these powerful sources of
light, this is one of the most important ways to characterize crystals that we have.
I always will.
I always have.
But we don't just blow bubbles in this class.
We don't just blow bubbles.
We really blow bubbles.
You want to do this?
You go ahead.
You go ahead.
That's the only way to blow bubbles.
That's combining an exothermic reaction with bubbles.
That is happiness.
That is happiness.
Success.
The power of the hydrogen bond.
OK.
