0:28
We'll see what happens.
0:50
We have lots of Jesses of both genders.
1:04
You've changed your hairstyle.
1:40
I'm going to walk you through this outline.
2:00
I'll explain why we have these covenants at the end.
2:23
My definition of artificial intelligence has
2:26
to be rather broad.
2:31
It's also about perception, and it's about action.
2:54
But this is not a philosophy class.
3:35
That's what we do at MIT.
4:14
You will get smarter.
4:33
So let's say that artificial intelligence is about
4:37
representations that support the making of models to
4:52
facilitate an understanding of thinking,
4:55
perception, and action.
5:03
Many of you have friends in mechanical engineering.
5:46
And we know about representation.
6:22
It's very powerful feeling.
6:26
Try it.
6:28
We need a demonstration.
7:29
We know that those are not the right representation.
8:36
This is at MIT approach to the farmer, fox,
8:39
goose, and grain problem.
8:40
It might have stumped you when you were a little kid.
10:02
We've got our constraints exposed.
10:18
And that's why we build representations.
11:24
I'd like to give you one more example.
11:42
So here's how it works.
12:33
MIT's full of them.
12:42
We're going to call it generate and test.
13:17
That's what I did with the leaf.
13:26
You can start to talk about it.
13:59
And that vocabulary gives you power.
14:10
This subject is full of powerful ideas.
14:24
She's gesturing like mad.
14:41
You can say the purpose of an aglet is pretty much like the
14:44
whipping on the end of a rope.
14:58
Symbolic labels give us power over concepts.
15:11
But it's a trivial idea.
16:27
We talked about an example of a method.
16:56
There's still one more thing.
17:15
And you solved that problem with your eyes.
18:57
But we can't teach you about stuff we don't understand.
19:05
That's a little bit about the definition and some examples.
19:33
But it amounts to studying the same sorts of things.
20:05
It used to be thought that we share 95% of our DNA with
20:08
chimpanzees.
20:16
I think we're back down to 94.
21:10
Screwball idea that persists to this day.
21:41
But Turing wrote his paper in 1950, and that was the first
21:44
milestone after Lady Lovelace's comment in 1842.
22:16
And you're going to understand exactly how it works.
22:18
And you can write one yourself.
24:20
It doesn't matter.
24:21
Something interesting will come.
24:25
OK, your choice.
24:28
Teal?
24:31
Burton House?
24:35
Teal.
24:59
The integration program was serious.
25:01
This one wasn't.
25:30
In the first case you deleted the inside figure.
25:44
There's another one.
25:50
I've forgotten.
25:51
A is to B as C is to 3.
27:09
And a program was written at Stanford that did diagnosis of
27:14
bacterial infections of the blood.
27:50
Here's that you don't know you used, or that was
27:52
used on your behalf.
28:19
There's Deep Blue.
29:26
I like to call at the age of the right way.
29:55
We had one example with Africa.
30:11
We're going to ask the system to imagine something.
30:19
I will imagine that a ball falls into a bowl.
30:33
OK.
30:33
I will imagine that a man runs into a woman.
30:48
I have learned from experience that contact between a man and
30:52
a woman appeared because a man runs into a woman.
31:12
I will imagine that a man gives a ball to a man.
31:31
I will imagine that a man flies.
31:51
And I've provided you with a little bit of a glimpse of
31:54
what we're going to look at as the semester unfolds.
33:25
There are some characteristics of our species that are
33:30
informative when it comes to guiding the activities of
33:34
people like me.
35:57
Descriptions enable us to tell stories.
36:03
That's going up.
36:24
What happens?
36:27
Your leg gets wet.
36:29
The water sloshes out.
36:34
You've probably never been told that that's what happens
36:37
when you run down the street with a full bucket of water.
36:43
There was internal imagination simulation.
37:01
You're going to stagger.
38:17
And each of these has a different purpose.
38:46
They're about powerful ideas.
38:52
They're about the experience side of the course.
38:59
MIT is about two things.
39:00
It's about skill building, and it's about big ideas.
39:13
But the experience you can only get at MIT.
39:16
I know everybody there is to know in artificial
39:18
intelligence.
39:18
I can tell you about how they think.
39:20
I can tell you about how I think.
39:21
And that's something you're not going to
39:22
get any other place.
39:43
They're taught at the same hour on Fridays.
39:49
And those are wrapped around past quiz problems.
39:55
It's very important component to the subject.
40:17
But you are MIT students.
40:19
And MIT people always like to look at the data.
41:37
And I have mixed feelings about that.
41:40
You're adults.
41:41
It's your call.
42:02
But I don't recommend it.
42:28
Here's what we do.
43:40
We have these boundaries where we think performance break
43:43
points are.
43:54
That is that your grade is calculated in several parts.
44:27
You get the max of the score you got on those two pieces.
44:36
I have a lot of guts.
44:44
It has been done.
44:46
We don't recommend it.
45:11
But that's roughly how it works.
45:21
I just want to talk a little bit about how we're going to
45:24
communicate with you in the next few days, while we're
45:27
getting ourselves organized.
45:48
There's the issue of whether we're going to have ordinary
45:58
recitation and a mega recitation this week.
46:00
So pay attention.
46:04
We're not going to have any regular recitations this week.
And we ask that you look at our home page for further
information about that as the week progresses.
