1:48
It's interesting.
2:42
But you can't find the best possible path. And the next letter is H. And it ends up
3:27
being choice.
3:30
Not about maps.
3:46
And I did something today that I neglected to do last time.
3:50
And that's talk to you about what I meant
3:52
by heuristic distance.
3:53
It's those pink lines that I just drew on the map.
4:23
It would appear that being at node E is a good place to be
4:26
because it's not very far from G.
5:43
PROFESSOR: S, A, D, G. So Juana asserts
5:59
that that is the best path.
7:47
And I could have gone this other way to B.
8:08
A and B. I can also go
8:25
to B. That's 7.
8:46
Last time we were talking a lot about
8:48
distances to the goal.
9:05
I've got 7 and 5. S, A, B.
10:17
S, B, A can only go to D.
10:27
Nothing else can happen there because that's 12 and I've got
10:30
a path of a goal that's 11.
10:33
C, I can only go to E.
10:43
That's 15.
11:22
Let's see. This distance is 0.
11:49
I can go either to A or B. That can either got to B
12:04
or D.
12:24
S, B takes me to A or C. You see the pattern.
12:39
Now let's see.
13:30
So let's see.
13:35
That gets this to the goal.
13:36
Boom, we've got it.
13:38
And we've got a path length of 11.
14:01
That's B, S, A, B. That goes to C. That's 11.
14:10
A goes to D. That adds 3.
14:13
That's 12.
14:15
C goes to E. That adds 6.
14:18
That's 15.
14:58
We've got a shortest path.
15:32
Each of those little flickers is trying another path.
15:57
Or it's almost doing British Museum.
16:38
We might have a shortest path to the goal.
17:22
Alas, it usually isn't.
18:09
Well, sort of.
18:51
An N queueing list.
21:18
So let's see how that would work on the classroom example.
21:38
N queued list won't work here.
22:13
B goes there.
22:13
And those path lengths are 7 and 6. And that goes to G. And the path length is 11. But I've already extended a
22:46
path that get to B.
22:56
I've already extended B. And
23:04
that those then to E with a path length of 15.
23:07
And I'm done.
23:24
The number of extensions.
24:00
I'm going to turn the speed down a little bit so
24:02
we can watch it.
24:04
It might take the rest of the hour.
24:05
Who knows?
24:13
Still doing a lot of work.
24:14
Still examining a lot of paths.
24:42
That's not a different algorithm.
25:08
It's a dead horse principle.
27:10
So forget that we've got an extended list.
27:48
We can go to A or B.
28:12
The airline distance from B to G is exactly 6.
28:53
Standard arithmetic 13.
28:57
The distance S, A, D.
29:47
They've got a tie score. And we have to calculate the best possible
30:05
distance that goes along those paths.
30:23
Also plus 7 plus.
30:25
Also 16 plus.
30:37
We extend that to G.
32:23
By the way, this is called an admissible heuristic.
33:45
Oops, that's the wrong adjustment.
34:12
It's an easier problem.
34:27
That went too fast.
34:35
Six extensions.
35:19
Look at that.
36:44
The number of extensions is 27.
36:47
So look at that.
36:49
A lot better than either of those working independently.
37:56
Sort's expensive.
37:58
Do we actually need to sort?
38:03
No, we don't actually need to sort.
38:12
That's an unnecessary computation.
39:00
But that's because I've been working with a map.
39:51
And the actual distances are 1, 1, 1, and 10.
40:17
But we're not.
40:17
We're going to use an admissible heuristic.
40:25
This guy is 0.
40:27
And this guy is 0.
41:25
That's equal to 101.
42:08
AUDIENCE: All right.
43:18
And that gets me to the goal.
43:53
S, A, C.
43:57
My accumulate distance it 2.
44:07
I've already extended that guy.
44:13
I won't find the shortest path because I'm
44:15
going to stop there.
44:27
This cannot be done as a map on a plane.
46:31
But the actual distance is only 2.
46:38
And it doesn't work.
47:37
And you can even invent pathological cases where it's
47:39
exponential and the distance to the goal.
47:56
It still holds.
47:57
No smoking, no drinking, and no laptops.
