 The one that's disappeared. At one level, you want to have a skill.
5:53
AUDIENCE: Trig substitution.
5:56
SPEAKER 1: Trig substitution.
6:10
These are the safe transformations. There's one more that I'm going to supply
8:01
you, because I don't think you'd guess it. That's our first step. And this was the hardest problem that it solved.
13:20
It's not an algorithm in the usual sense that we talk about algorithms. But you can't get an A in calculus without
13:42
knowing some of them. We'll call this heuristic transformation A. We could do that. But there's another thing we can do. We've got four safe transformations. It's already written as a function of sine and cosine. But we can also rewrite that
20:35
in terms of tangent and cosecant. That's g3 up there. Problem reduction tree,
22:57
and/or tree, goal tree, all the same thing.
26:04
SPEAKER 1: The fewest symbols in it. Military background or something like that. Maybe
27:30
he flies airplanes. As this one, I don't know. I can't give
30:27
up on that last thing. We've got our complete architecture. 32k of memory, that's 32k of memory. It's amazing
35:10
that he was able to do anything with a machine of that size. This failed for
36:15
uninteresting reasons on 2 of the 56 problems that it was given to. And that brings
39:29
me to the things I've got on that upper right-hand board. There was a similar table of integrals. Knowledge about goal trees was embedded in
40:43
the procedure, so it was procedurally represented. You might be surprised by the answer.
41:36
First of all, the table of integrals.
41:58
How about the transformations here, the safe ones, about 12. How about the heuristic ones,
42:11
about 12. It would beat the most dedicated mathematicians at integration.
43:05
And its descendents are in MATLAB today.
43:08
But this is how it all works. It will make you smarter.
