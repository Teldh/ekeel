I couldn't do that on the board.
And there's lots and lots of those kinds of videos.
We left off with the homonuclear dimers.
OK.
This is how we roll when we talk about MOs.
And this is how we start.
These are my AOs for the 2 nitrogen atoms.
Gesundheit.
OK. OK.
And in oxygen, you've got your 6 valence electrons in the 2p.
OK.
And you've also got that 2s.
Pi and pi star, right?
Sigma p.
Sigma p.
2p, 2s, sigma.
Sigma 2p star.
Yep.
This and there and there for oxygen.
It has unpaired.
This is O2.
N2 doesn't have any unpaired electrons so it's not paramagnetic.
We talked about that on Friday.
OK.
OK.
But for a heteronuclear dimer, the bonding MOs are closer in energy to the more electronegative
atom.
Electroneg atom.
Atom.
This axis is energy.
OK.
But it's closer in energy to the more electronegative levels.
OK.
That's why I've got some videos.
OK.
It's a little bit better.
Sigma star 2s with two electrons.
Sigma 2p with two electrons.
That's how that looks.
OK.
If it's greater than zero, it's stable.
And the higher the bond order, the higher the bond strength.
Nope.
Plus 2, plus 4 minus 2.5.
And it's kind of interesting.
OK.
And the last point I wanted to make about MO theory before we talk about hybridization is with one
other example, and that's HTL.
OK.
OK.
Fine.
OK.
3p.
And chlorine's got 7 electrons in the 3p.
Sigma 3p, sigma 3p bond.
But that's OK because the s can talk to a sigma p.
The s can talk to this.
That's OK.
So they can't make their pi orbitals.
They can't do that.
These stay there exactly at the same place.
They're not doing anything different.
They're just hanging out.
Those electrons are non-bonding.
Nb.
Nb.
That's a non-bonding orbital.
Non-bonding orbitals.
These are not going to count.
These do not participate in bonding.
I got to fill this.
OK.
One of them brought too many electrons to the party.
But it's OK.
They're just going to stay there and wait.
OK.
Fine.
MO theory.
They can also do this.
They can combine to form a new orbital.
It's called a hybrid orbital.
This is hybridization.
Hybridization.
This is really important.
That's why I'm writing it all out.
Because that's what this is all about.
I'm going to take an example of methane.
This is definitely getting repetitive.
H1s.
But I did it.
And you get your methane molecule.
That's what this is all about.
You just change the boundary conditions.
And this is where I think a movie helps.
It's like a minute long.
You're solving the equation.
That's true.
The carbon atom only hybridizes when it is in a bonding situation.
Lower potential energy.
Happier.
That's what this is all about.
OK.
OK.
And that allowed it to do this.
Ethylene.
Ethylene is used.
This is used in so many applications I can't possibly list them.
Because for ethylene, each carbon atom needs 3 bonds.
Each carbon atom needs 3 equivalent bonds.
And they will go to 3 sp2 orbitals.
And I got one left over.
One left over.
But that's OK.
That's OK.
There's another 2p orbital on the other carbon.
It forms a bond.
It forms a pi bond.
And you've got a bond from this.
We know so much more.
It's like a little spring.
Because it's minimum in energy is when these things can maximize their overlap.
OK.
Consequently-That's cool animation.
--this hybridization is termed as sp2 hybridization.
OK.
1.
This bubble here is all of the ocean water.
It's frozen.
Which is what I'm doing.
Through a membrane.
That's called a reverse osmosis membrane, because you're going against the osmotic pressure.
In fact, membranes for desalination are pretty bad.
Those polyamide membranes are destroyed by chlorine.
That's not much.
They still will go through the cost to remove it.
They will remove it from the feed.
By the way, there's 40,000 of these membranes in this plant.
Each one is 2 meters long and 40 square meters of area.
And then the product water.
That's cost.
A better membrane could change this.
You can't Snapchat on that.
OK.
You can't Snapchat on that.
That's what I meant.
We can do so much better.
And so-OK.
This beautiful material that we have now understood more than we did before.
We talked about it in the context of benzene.
You know so much more.
You know why graphene is so special.
And those electrons are critical.
It's sp2 hybridization.
This is like the ultimate membrane.
I can put it in negative pH solutions.
I can heat it up.
It doesn't degrade.
OK.
We did see 2H4.
One to the hydrogen and one to the other carbon.
That's sp hybridization.
Awe.
OK.
They're orthogonal.
They're orthogonal.
And so-so two of them are coming at the other atom.
OK.
Forms pipe bond network, forms sigma bond network.
It's not just carbon that hybridizes.
BeH2.
And all sorts of other things.
The deal orbitals can get in on the action.
That's what hybridization is.
OK.
It's written right up there.
We're just keeping on saying the same thing.
OK.
I don't go there.
I don't go there.
OK.
