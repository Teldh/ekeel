But even such structures can't escape the fact that you always have vacancies.
That was cool.
This is not the only thing that glass means.
But this is what we think of.
OK.
We'll talk about that.
OK, and we'll see another one.
That's cool.
But it still had this long range-gesundheit-order.
That is not what glass is.
Glass is disordered.
It's going to look random.
This is called amorphous as opposed to crystalline.
This is also called glass.
This is also called glass.
No.
Glass is equal to an amorphous solid.
It's broader.
It's bolder.
You can have metallic glass.
OK.
And that is called quartz.
So processing.
And there is lots of processing parameters and we can talk about.
We'll talk about the chemistry.
We'll talk about the processing.
This is quartz.
This is how you see quartz.
And it is ordered.
That's why I'm saying the word crystal.
I'm not saying the word glass.
It's not cubic.
But it's still periodically repeating.
It's got long range order.
It's called quartz.
We're going to go from long-range to short-range.
I'm going to put those like that.
So oxygen has six.
And you'll see why I'm focusing on this SiO4 group in a minute.
That's what I got.
That's called a silicate.
That's a silicate group.
SiO4.
I need those four electrons to make it happy.
OK.
It's called lime, calcium oxide.
But it's made from sodium carbonate, which is soda.
OK.
That's an isolated molecule.
I almost forgot.
No.
That is not true.
That is not true.
We do the calculation.
OK.
Class doesn't flow.
OK.
I wanted to get that done early.
OK, so this is quartz.
This is crystalline silica.
This was how we made a molecule happy.
And they're kind of happy, and they're on their own.
That is what quartz is.
And I can't draw it.
And they all act as bridges between silicate groups.
OK.
They stay together.
Glass is what we're going to get to.
It's when they're disordered.
OK.
You see that?
That thing can rotate around.
That is what's being passed around.
And you can imagine these things are kind of bulky groups coming together and twisting around.
And it depends on a couple of things.
And that's what I want to talk about next.
It depends on the temperature and the cooling.
OK.
It goes like this.
That's why solids expand.
You see.
That's why you have thermal expansion.
Things are vibrating.
That's so efficient.
Thermal expansion.
It's the thermal expansion coefficient of the material.
I get to this point.
This point here is where everything changes.
Everything changes.
It goes through a phase transition.
And it becomes a liquid.
That's why those slopes are different.
There's a sudden volume change.
That actually wasn't an intentional pun.
That's called super cooling.
By the way, so this is called super cooling.
By the way, you can do that with water.
This is what you're going to get.
They should.
This is what you should see in your glass.
You can't just put bottles in a freezer.
That won't work.
It's really cool.
It's really cool.
OK.
OK.
And I'm going to need another plot to do this.
And you could become a solid right where you were.
You might not go down to the crystal curve, but you might start a new curve.
This is volume per mole.
But I went past it.
There's the crystal.
OK.
It's got the same slope as the crystal.
OK.
They didn't find the lattice.
And that's how you have a higher chance of forming glass.
More-I'll just draw an arrow.
Higher would lead to glass.
Higher complexity of the lattice.
You got lots of time, but what if I just stop it.
The liquid line comes in.
You're cooling it down.
There's the thermal expansion.
The melting point of the crystal is always the same number.
It's always the same number.
These are glasses.
Those are different.
And they have different solidification temperatures.
No.
It's not a crystal.
I didn't let any of it find crystals sites.
But that's why it's hard to make glasses out of metals.
Metals as liquids typically aren't very viscous.
The musical chairs of metals is easy.
It's an easy game.
That's why the silicates never played musical chairs with metals.
This is flow glass.
You make them into a liquid.
You float it over molten tin.
The tin acts like this really nice smooth surface that you put the glass on top of.
So one liquid on top of another makes a very nice smooth interface.
That's crystalline.
That's quartz.
This is glass.
Quartz, glass, crystalline, amorphous.
This is what glass would look like.
You can still control the properties.
You can still control the properties.
So the properties can be highly engineered.
No.
It's not just glass.
It's very complicated mixtures of silica with other things.
Lime CaO, magnesia, alumina.
In fact, 90% of all glass is called soda glass.
And I found this.
They had a little bit less silica.
But they mixed all sorts of things in.
No.
It's stuck here.
That made me happy.
This all goes back to the chemistry.
We'll do more next week.
