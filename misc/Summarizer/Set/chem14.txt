What sorts of interactions can they have?
And those are really important.
Bond, a model.
You'll see what I mean.
I'm going to draw a little cartoon.
OK.
OK.
And we know that that's going to go like Coulomb's Law.
Something we've already talked about.
OK.
Two atoms like this.
It's complicated.
There is no.
It is.
But it's a complicated R dependence.
OK.
Mm.
Mm.
I'm not even-I'm just getting started.
And there's a variety of ways.
That's that polar covalent bond that we've already talked about.
But I want to remind you of what happens.
But it's still a covalent bond.
We used these symbols.
And we also talked about how that leads you to a dipole moment.
OK.
Two charges.
Those aren't full charges.
Those are partial charges.
And they're separated by some distance, the distance between these two atoms.
And you get a dipole moment.
And it has a magnitude and a direction.8D.
And 1D is equal to 3.
Charge times distance.
Charge times distance.
OK.
3.
Debyes.
And we'll call that ion-dipole.
OK.
OK.
And it goes as 1 over r squared.
I won't derive any of it.
OK.
Good.
OK.
Good.
That's a different kind of bond.
And I got a picture for that.
And it's also color coded.
OK.
And I put an electric field on.
And I put an electric field on.
These dipoles mean that they're going to align with the field.
They're going to align with the field.
OK.
It's two dipoles, two HCl molecules.
And they can also repel.
Dipole-dipole.
OK.
OK.
OK.
Now-gesundheit.
They're dipole charges interacting with dipole charges.
It's a polar covalent bond.
This could happen from a molecule to a molecule.
It could happen from an atom to a molecule.
It could happen from a molecule to an atom.
This is what I wrote over on the other side.
That's my delta minus.
It still has feelings.
Because it has electrons.
But that's OK, because those electrons still can feel.
They can feel the dipole of this.
They can feel the dipole of this molecule.
They react to it.
By the way, it could happen-it could happen with a sodium atom.
They're going to react to it.
And that leads to another kind of bond.
It actually leads to another kind of bond.
H-gesundheit.
H.
It is not a molecule with a dipole.
It comes down to feelings.
That has a name.
That's ion.
Ion-induced dipole.
OK.
OK.
I'm going to draw the original shape as what it was.
That's what it was.
OK.
It got induced.
Remember, cation anion.
But the ion in this case is interacting with what is called a polarizable-polarizable electron cloud.
We got an electron cloud nailed.
We know about electron cloud.
Because those are orbitals.
And that's a very important term.
Na+ and H, H.
OK.
How polarizable are my electrons?
I need to know.
These are induced dipoles.
OK.
That's important.
OK.
What about these other things?
Right.
But that's kind of the obvious case.
You've lost some charge from the carbon.
It's gone out to the chlorine atom.
There's a dipole movement within each bond.
So this molecule is not a polar molecule.
On the other hand, molecules NH3 or CH3Cl-right.
It's a non-polar molecule.
OK.
OK.
I went out of the lines.
I was so careful.
But you can't-you can't hold chemistry.
No way.
No way.
Mm.
OK.
And the example-let's go back to HCl.
HCl, there's my dipole coming in ClCl.
I like that because it's got three Cls.
That's not so little.
OK.
OK.
You knew this was coming.
This moment today was going to come.
It's true.
They don't have this dipole.
They're non-polar.
They're just atoms sitting there with their symmetric charge clouds.
And there is a picture.
There's two helium atoms.
It's pretty cold.
And there's two non-polar molecules, H2.
You get fluctuations.
I didn't mean it.
We already know that I can induce another dipole if I'm charged.
It leads to a bond.
And that is called London dispersion.
OK.
London dispersion.
Notice there's room for one more.
It's coming.
There's more.
We're not done.
We are not done.
Fluctuations.
By dipole fluctuations.
OK.
And we've already talked about this.
Those electrons that are going to do the shifting to cause the fluctuation-those electrons are more
loosely bound.
They're further out.
They're more loosely bound.
We've already talked about this.
We've looked at this in a lot of ways.
I'm not taking them out.
I'm not taking them out.
But I'm moving them.
I got to fluctuate it.
The other thing that you can imagine with London is that these interactions, these fluctuations,
they're happening all over the place.
Methane, ethane, propane, and butane.
They've got no charge on them.
You can have more.
And that's how this bond-that's how this thing works.
there's no other option.
This is C5.5.
This is not the ground state.
The most stable structure is here.
It's like a nickname for it.
It's coming into contact with itself.
I want to clear this up.
I have nowhere to go here.
OK.
It can happen.
And it does.
It's always there.
OK.
So London is always there.
OK.
But we know more than that.
We know the distinction.
Gesundheit.
Polarizable electron cloud, that's all you got.5 to 40.
But really cool stuff.
This is like a 30-second video.
He found the answer in the sheer number and design of the hairs on the geckos feet.
Geckos have millions of microscopic hairs on their toes.
And each of those hairs branch down to billions of little split ends.
No.
London, London.
Because it's that last line.
It's that last line.
That's what you'd expect.
It's a very unique kind of bond.
And so a hydrogen bond is our last intermolecular bond.
And it's a very particular kind of bond.
Earth's operating conditions are luckily right here.
So hydrogen bonds are unique.
Those are the three elements that are in this trend.
Those are the three elements.
This is very high.
There's the covalent bond between the oxygen and hydrogen.
Mm.
Mm.
OK.
You can see.
I've created two of these very strong delta pluses, and I've got two lone pairs.
That's why water is so special.
This bond is so important.
And it has a boiling point of 78.5 degrees.
It's boiled off.
It's the exact same chemical formula.
It's the exact same chemical formula.
So it cannot hydrogen bond.
It can London.
You know.
But it can't hydrogen. It can't.
Because the oxygen has the lone pairs.
Really good thing.
