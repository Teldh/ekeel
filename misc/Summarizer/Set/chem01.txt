Welcome to 3.091.
This is the first day.
And I'm really excited.
I hope you are too.
My name is Jeff Grossman.
And I did a post-doc at Berkeley.
So one example is in this material.
And what we do today with this barrel of oil is we mostly burn it.
A lot of what we do is burn it.
And that's just one example.
And that's still working with just one element, carbon.
And that's what we're going to talk about in this class over the fall.
Seven.
27.
It depends.
63 elements.
And I'll mention it when they come around during the year.
OK, so that's a little intro to me.
But we also need to know what atoms are there in the first place.
We can get properties.
We can get structure.
We can get performance.
They're all correlated.
The electronic structure of the elements holds the key.
And the first part of this class is really the basic foundations of chemistry.
Some of you may have seen some of this before.
We're going to build these elements.
We're going to talk about them.
We're going to learn about the electrons and the electronic structure.
You are not alone.
You have your TA.
You have Laura.
You have the textbook and the internet.
Who said --that was.
So the textbook is Averill.
It's a really good textbook.
It's a really good textbook.
Notes, like I said, will be posted on the same day of each lecture.
I'll post whatever you see on this screen.
I will post.
The goody bag.
And these will be given out nine weeks.
Everything's related to lecture.
But at least one will be related to what's in the bag.
This is a very important part of your homework.
Some of which you need to bring to the quiz.
I believe in the soul of MIT.
I said the soul of MIT.
You've got a group of really smart people.
What should we do?
And they wrote out a plan.
They wrote out a plan.
And it's called the institute plan.
That makes sense, 1860.
It's a great read.
That is Mens et Manus.
That is Mens et Manus.
Mind and Hand.
It's so important to MIT that we put it on our logo.
We put it on our logo.
We don't put some animal on our logo.
We don't put the word truth.
I don't know.
I know you're in the classroom because you signed up for it.
Agreement.
But you are also here because you are going to experience a transition.
That is MIT.
That's mens et manus.
It's on you.
We feel responsibility.
OK?
All right.
Good.
I've got a pen.
It's from around 3,000 BC.
And the way they made that was by taking stuff from a meteor.
But from a meteor.
They called those daggers from heaven.
And some of you may have heard this.
There's earth.
There's fire.
There's air.
And there's water.
And everything is made out of that.
If I look out into the stars, they don't seem to change much.
Democritus.
And atom is indivisible.
And they fought about this.
That's a-back in the day, that was a serious diss.
I was right.
Democritus.
And I think a lot of you have seen the scientific method.
But it was pivotal for chemistry.
It was pivotal.
He was going for that core.
He did it by burning things.
He studied these reactions that were happening with oxygen and carbon containing matter.
It was combustion.
He burned this.
Priestley wanted to blow stuff up.
He actually worked with beer.
And that makes me think about combustion.
And this is what you're doing.
You are lighting a candle on fire.
You're combusting that fuel.
You could light propane on fire.
Or you could light hydrogen on fire.
There's the candle, which is tilting.
I'm watching it.
Or you could light hydrogen on fire.
But I'm going to stop.
These are bigger boulders.
You might not feel it.
You are.
No, I'm-I love that reaction.
I love that reaction.
You are lighting a fire.
And so this study of combustion was extremely important. He discovered oxygen.
He also discovered these other gases coming out.
It's not balanced.
It's not balanced.
It's also important in life.
But it's very important in chemistry.
I wrote this down.
I'm just testing you.
I made a mistake.
These are balanced.
These are balanced.
And balancing reactions is important.
Once we count atoms, you'll see.
We're going to count atoms on Friday.
But it's telling us that you can't just lose stuff.
You can't just lose stuff.
No.
Lavoisier?
No.
Lavoisier.
You can't lose-you can't create or destroy matter when you do chemistry.
Conservation of mass, Lavoisier.
But you also can think about whether you have anything-I probably should blow that out.
Two, three, four.2 grams of FE203.
There's none left.2 grams of ferric acid, I must have reacted 8.2 grams of oxygen.
That's conservation of mass.
But there's another thing you can do with this.2 grams of oxygen.
I'm going to have excess.
And the thing is that there's something that's limiting here.
And he tried to organize them.
And in some cases, he succeeded fairly well.
And some of these are actually really good discoveries.
I want you to experience this.1.
I've given you five metal strips.
But I gave you vinegar.
And you do lots with vinegar.
Different color, densities.
But we won't tell President Reif about that.
You know, think outside the box.
You've got these strips of pipette.
And you've got some gloves.
And that is your first goody bag.
I will always let you go on time, 11:55.
So two and a half minutes.
We name the age we live in often by the element, by the atom, by the material, by the material that
was most useful at the time.
I would say we've moved through the industrial age, the age of plastics, the age of silicon.
I love that you name the age you live in by the material that mattered.
And that is really important.
And I mentioned the phone and the 63 elements.
This is called a revolution.
In 2012, it became cheaper to print a transistor on a chip than a character in a newspaper.
And that is our construction set.
And we will build this on Friday.
