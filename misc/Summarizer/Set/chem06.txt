Last week we talked about-we went quantum.
We had Dr.
These are my two favorite quantum mechanicists of all time.
I believe that this sign is meant to teach us something about the double slit experiment.
The electron-we are all waves.
It's really a thing.
Because it's true.
We are all waves.
You really are.
It's true.
We are-right?
That's deep.
We are waves.
All of us.
We've got that. Eq.
And it was captured automatically.
And this is also the quantization.
Continuous energies.
So the powerful point here is that from that equation-and we don't need to know this equation.
We're not going to derive it.
That's what we're talking about today.
OK.
It is a direct result of solving this equation.
One solution.
And some energy.
That's it.
But there are only certain ones that are going to work.
And we solve it for an electron waving in the presence of the potential of the atom.
Which is a positive potential. Eq.
Schrodinger equation.
But the way that we're going to do this is in spherical coordinates.
Spherical coords.
And that's just a standard way to solve mathematical equations.
So separate.
And this is deep.
OK.
That's how we speak when we speak quantum.
I don't know.
But there's a probability that it's there.
And this would be n equals 1.
That electron isn't in one place, but it is.
But it's not.
There is a finite probability that that's true.
They're small, you know.
There's a chance.
It's close.
And that's where we say orbital.
That's why we stay it.
We're listing quantum numbers.
Radial distance.
And you can see right there.
Because those higher end functions go to 0.
And there's more of them.
Heisenberg said no way.
In this one place.
This node.
It's 0.
It's literally 0.
It cannot exist there.
It's the same electron.
It skips over a zero probability part, r.
The probability there is always 0.
Because there's no classical analog to these things.
There's no classical analog.
But this is what electrons do in an atom.
But it's one electron.
And this is its probability distribution.
Force the issue.
We still don't know.
That's great.
I find that incredible.
It's poetry.
That's cool.
Right?
Quantum mechanics.
It's quantization of energies.
It's not very interesting.
And you take a little tiny piece of it.
We call that a quantum dot.
But the electron is up in an energy level, and it left behind a hole.
A hole is just a positive charge.
They literally ran out of real estate.
They ran out of atoms.
I am squeezing these quantum mechanical objects, this electron and this hole.
Because I'm changing its quantum mechanical interactions.
Every element can do more things than we thought possible because we can tune these properties
related to quantum mechanics.
That's a very big deal.
OK.
For an electron in an atom.
And what happens with theta is, you get another quantization of that variable.
And that's the second quantum number.
OK, so the second one is l.
And it's the angular quantum number.
That's it.
There's no other options.
This is called spectroscopic notation, because it comes from spectroscopists.
s was sharp.
Spherically symmetric.
p was principle, because it sort of dominated in some experiments. d was more diffuse.
P orbital.
Three orientations.
OK.
These are quantum numbers.
OK?
All right.
Five d orbitals.
You get them all.
We needed to go quantum to answer that.
That's good.
And they're going to shoot a classical magnet.
There's a classical magnet.
You'd shoot them through a high field, and you don't get anything.
You get two things.
Only two.
All done.
It could be spinning this way or that way.
In a way, it helps our classical needs.
Separate from those experiments.
The fourth quantum number.
So many ways to distinguish two things that are opposite.
Two values that this can have.
No electrons in the same atom can have the same quantum numbers.
Orbital.
OK.
I got to go-I know.
I got to go backwards here.
I got to work on my arm.
It's extremely exciting.
And we're going to start by filling elements.
Two electrons.
They are just neutral atoms going up above hydrogen.
This is what you really get in terms of energy.
And I want to talk about both of them in the last seven minutes of class.
I'm going over here.
15.
Right?
Now, 15 protons.
5, 6, 7, 8.
That's eight electrons.
And you can already see what's happening.
They are happy.
Low energy.
Right?
The lower your energy, the happier.
You're in a lower energy, ground state.
More bound.
Those electrons in here-these shield the outer electrons, these shield outer electrons by two
electrons.
I see 13-ish.
That's shielding.
Those are shielding another eight protons.
So these ones have sort of an effective-z effective.
This is not the z of the atom, but it's sort of like those very outer electrons don't see the whole proton
cloud.
And that's a very important part of what happens to orbitals when you put a lot of electrons in them.
That was 2s.
And that is why these two things are different.
It finds a lower happy place.
