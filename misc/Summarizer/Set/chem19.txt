Packing fraction.
We calculated things like the closed pack direction.
But you could write the density in terms of the things we talked about on Monday.
So example, copper.
Everything.55 grams per mole.
And I also look up the atomic radius.
And that's equal to 1.3 angstroms.
And that got us how we get the radius of the atom.
But I also know that there's four atoms per unit cell because it's FCC.
So the volume of these cells are cubic.
From this information, I can compute the density.
Bravais lattices.
It's over there on the right.
That's not right.
They are not the things that you put at that point.
The basis is what you put there.
And this is my crystal.
That's OK.
I have done nothing wrong.
Because I have simply, according to the rules of crystallography, I've had a lattice and a basis.
And I've just defined my basis as a cat.
Those are FCC crystals.
But at the same time, if my basis-check this out.
This is salt. This is salt.
This is not simple cubic because they're different.
They're different.
And this has a name.
It's called the rock salt structure.
It's called the rock salt structure.
This is diamond.
There are actually a number of pairs of that would form this diamond.
In fact, we specify because there are different types.
This is called cubic diamond crystal.
This is the cubic diamond crystal.
It's FCC.
But it's still just a pair of atoms.
That's what diamond is.
So the symmetry is FCC.
This looks seriously directionally dependent.
And it's called anisotropy.
Directionally dependent.
And they came up with crystallography over the years.
And they have very strong ideas about notation.
x is coming out of the board.
There's copper.
This point here.
This is just where we are.
We're just getting warmed up.
And that goes from a point to a vector.
We know what vectors are.
And I've got this for the direction and I've got this for the planes.
No commas.
This is 0.
This is 0.
It didn't go halfway.
It's not 1/2.
But along the z direction, it's 1/2.
We multiply everything by 2.
We put it in brackets.
And everyone is happy.
201.
That is the 201 direction.
In this crystal.
That is the 201 direction.
They don't like fractions.
They don't like negative signs.
0, 1 bar, 0.
OK, 01bar0.
These are vectors in crystals.
That's to stamp.
Crystallographers, you've got to keep them happy.
You've got to keep them happy.
That is direction.
You push it.
You pull it.
You break it.
You hammer it.
This is just one example.
Almost a cube.
We got one whistle.
But this never does.
This never does.
And it's infinite.
That's a nice way to fix infinity.
We use parentheses.
You don't want to talk about a vector by accident.
It's the 001 plane in this crystal.
I have it.
The 001 plane.
That's what this is about.
And that's y.
And that's x.
And that's z.
It's almost a cube.
I've gone here to 1/2.
That's 1/2 of the cell length.
This is 3/4 of the cell length.
We don't like fractions.
We got to get rid of fractions.
And we get 634.
That is 634 plane.
In the unit cell, the one that cuts it.
I'm OK with that.
It's an infinite set of planes.
OK.
If you want to look at it as a set of planes, you've got to put one at the origin.
That will help you think through what I mean.
The set of infinite planes also would have one at the origin, one half way, one at the top.
And this is really important.
It's an infinite number of them.
That is enough information.
The distance between these planes is a.
And in fact, for a cubic cell, there's a formula that you can use for any two planes.
The distance and the plane there is equal to a.
Those are just variables.
That works.
If it's 200, that works.
And it's general.
That becomes very important.
And you can see this from this very simple picture.
There's the 001 plane.
So the 001 plane and the 001 vector are orthogonal.
I followed the rules.
But you don't need to know that derivation so I'm just telling it to you.
As I said in the beginning.
There's a simple cubic crystal.
The basis is one atom.
The density of atoms in these planes is different.
And that has a real serious impact on the properties.
If we look at this example of simple cubic, that's a very easy case.
Lattice constant a.
It's being shared by four other squares.
But the number atoms equal to 1.
That's a pretty easy case.
You see that?
The area in that plane is different.
So the density of atoms in the plane is different.
So the density in the plane affects properties.
And you can see how it breaks.
You can actually see how it breaks.
It's breaking along the weakest plane.
It's breaking along the weakest plane.
That was deep.
The property, as I said before, depends heavily on which plane you're in.52 angstroms.
But I also know that it's BCC.
Unit cell edge, radius of the atom.5 angstroms.
Packing density.
And I can compare this plane with another plane with another plane.
