Let's get started.
We're going to keep talking about polymers today.
OK.
The importance of the double bond.
This would have some monomer.
But it's got to have with a double bond.
--monomers.
You could give off other things.
There's a lot of examples.
There are a number of ways.
Whereas in this case, it's a little bit less because you did a reaction.
OK.
That's what we did on Monday.
How we can change them.
Different ways that we can change them.
We know grams per mole.
Maybe orders of magnitude longer.
So the interactions.
All of those apply to polymers.
They all apply.
I've got polystyrene.
They have to come out of the parentheses.
That's polyvinyl alcohol.
I can say well, just look at those monomers.
That's what goes into the brackets or the parentheses.
Everyone has London.
That's got hydrogen bonds.
These are macromolecules.
These are macromolecules.
OK.
Which one is it?
It's polystyrene.
That's polystyrene in three different forms.
They have the exact same polymer.
Polystyrene.
It could.
And I just saved three letters.
Now crystallinity density, memories.
Good memories.
I can make a crystal.
I can crystallize right here.
That's what we did before with glasses.
That's temperature.
It might form a crystal.
It's really hard to line it all up.
And so a lot of it will not find that place.
These are all monomers.
Now LDPE and HDPE.
It's the exact same material that's in over 30% of all toys on the planet.
It's still polyethylene.
We've messed with the density.
One we just talked about.
I'll call it processing.
That's right here.
Physical structure.
Bullet one.
And another is called tacticity.
OK.
It always seems to come back to pasta.
It's going to take up more room in the bowl.
There's the benzene ring.
It's not branching.
But you can call them little branches.
And you can change the melting point by a hundred degrees.
Right, of the same material.
Same chemistry.
Isotactic to atactic.
It's called the nylon rope pole.
It's so cool.
Two liquids with two different monomers and you pull a solid out of the interface.
And that's this.6.
And this is what you get.
And there's your polymer.
No. OK.
And it goes on.
It's 6.6.6.
That's the amide bond.
You can.
It can happen.
It's the specific link that's in the chain.
We're going to talk about rubber.
But we'll talk about him in a minute.
There's rubber coming right out of a tree.
But I only need one to polymerize this.
And an H there.
And this is polyisoprene.
It's this really cool mold.
And it stayed.
But people really wanted to make something out of this stuff.
It seemed really neat.
And he accidentally left rubber on his stove with sulfur.
It all comes back to the double bond.
It all comes back to the double bond.
That sounds pretty cool.
I'm going to give an electron from this double bond.
And it finds the double bond that's in another polyisoprene strand.
And he played with lots of things.
And his greatest discovery was completely by accident.
And he never made any money off of it.
Goodyear called it vulcanization.
And he accidentally left it on the fire.
That's what they were after-flexibility and hardness.
And then these linkages kick in.
This is covalent.
But there's something different about this one and it's so cool.
There's a timescale involved.
Because you are up against the speed of hydrogen bond forming and reforming.
And that is incredibly cool.
You are literally feeling the formation, the destruction and formation of hydrogen bonds.
This material, slime, that polymer is below its glass transition temperature.
I meant above.
I erased it?
I erased it.
It's this like super cooled viscous liquid.
But what I've done with the cross-linkers is I've said hold on.
You can't go away.
It is a viscous liquid.
But the cross-linkers are sort of holding it in place.
But it's the same thing.
Somebody shot a bullet through it.
It breaks like glass.
And that's leads to viscoelasticity.
And on Friday.
And I gave an example of an ocean cleanup project.
We call that a thermostat.
It's almost impossible.
On the other hand, a thermoplastic has this kind of plastic deformation.
So it can really stretch and stretch and stretch.
But it doesn't have the cross-linkers.
That's why you can do that.
It's elastic when we want.
That's like one of the dreams in making environmentally friendly plastic.
